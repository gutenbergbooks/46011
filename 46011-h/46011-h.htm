  <h1 class='c005'>THE MOVING PICTURE BOYS AND THE FLOOD</h1>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />A LONG-DISTANCE CALL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Say, this looks bad, Joe! It sure does!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that, Blake? Must be quite serious,
to make you sit up and take notice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is! Look at the scare head!” and the
speaker held out, for the inspection of his companion,
a newspaper the front page of which
fairly bristled with black type.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were two youths, sitting under a cherry
tree, on the green grass of a lawn which fronted
a farmhouse. They were evidently taking their
ease, or had been, for there were comfortable
chairs near them, two hammocks, and a pile of
magazines, while on a board seat, built into a
crotch of the cherry tree, was a large pitcher of
lemonade. And if that doesn’t show comfort on
a warm, sunny June day I don’t know what does.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’d you get that paper?” asked Joe
Duncan, as he accepted the sheet his companion,
Blake Stewart, passed over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It came in the mail, but I didn’t take it out
of the wrapper until a second ago. It’s yesterday’s.
Some news that; eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It sure is,” and as Joe began to read, Blake
looked over his shoulder, murmuring such expressions
as: “Worst flood in years! Many
houses swept away! Toll of lives will be heavy!
Many deeds of heroism! Mississippi on great
rampage!”</p>

<p class='c008'>What Blake gave expression to was merely
quoted from some of the lines in the heading
of the article that had so excited him and his
chum. It was a telegraphed story of a big flood
on the Mississippi, which, the article stated, was
higher than it had been in years, while unusually
heavy spring rains had added to the terrors of
the rising waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That sure is some flood!” murmured Joe,
as he reached the bottom of the newspaper page,
and turned the sheet over. “Hello!” he cried.
“They’ve got some pictures of it, too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost all of the second page was taken up
with half-tone cuts of scenes in the flooded districts.
There were views of overturned houses
being swept down a turbulent stream, pictures of
half-demolished buildings, jammed together into
a rude sort of raft, on which could be seen farm
animals; views of whole towns partly inundated,
and people being taken from roofs and out of
third-story windows in small boats. It was a
photographic story of untold misery and desolation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir, that sure is some flood, Blake,”
murmured Joe. “And do you know what I
think?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I might make a guess at it, old man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Joe did not give his chum a chance. He
went on hastily:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think we ought to go out there with our
moving picture cameras, and get some films of
that flood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought you were going to say that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’re not surprised. But how does it
strike you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I sure would like to see the Mississippi
on a tear the like of which she’s having now, for
it would be something worth remembering. And
I suppose we could make a neat little sum, over
and above our expenses, if we went out there
and got a lot of films. We could work them off
through the moving picture newspaper syndicate
easily enough. But you know why we came out
here to Central Falls; don’t you, Joe?” added
Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To get a good rest in the country, of course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s it, and we’re getting it. There isn’t
anything I like better than this,” and Blake, who
had stretched out in lazy luxury on the grass,
looked up at the blue sky, and into the cherry
tree, which was laden with luscious fruit. “All
I want now is a robin to come along, pick the
cherries and drop them down to me,” went on
Blake, with a grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, you don’t want much,” laughed Joe.
“But it sure is nice here,” and he looked across
the fertile farm acres that stretched away to the
rear, and on either side of the comfortable house,
in the shade of which they were taking their
ease.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Finest place we could strike to spend a vacation,”
agreed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, all the same, I think we’re missing a
chance if we don’t go out there and get some
Mississippi flood pictures,” went on Joe. “How
does it strike you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, I wish you hadn’t mentioned it, Joe!
Now you’ve got me going! If we hadn’t seen
a big story of it in the papers we’d be content
to sit here, and take it easy. But, now that the
germ has got to working——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’ll go there with me, and take our
moving picture cameras along; won’t you?” interrupted
Joe, eagerly. “I tell you we may never
have another chance like this!</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got pictures of earthquakes, of volcanoes
in eruption, of wild animals fighting, and
lots of other exciting things. But we never yet
tackled a flood,” went on Joe, with ever-growing
enthusiasm. “And you know moving water always
shows up well on the films.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I can see what all this is leading to,”
broke in Blake. “Good-bye to all the fine, lazy
times we’ve been having the last two weeks. No
more lying in bed as long as you like—no more
chicken dinners—we’ll be lucky if we can hold a
sandwich in one hand and grind away at the
crank of the moving picture camera with the
other. Good-bye to a good day’s fishing in the
brook. No more cherry pie, and no more lemonade
in the shade. And, speaking of lemonade,
we might as well finish this pitcher, and get
ready to go. I can see what is going to happen,”
and he sighed in pretended dolefulness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t go just because I suggested it,
Blake,” said Joe, quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, I’m not blaming you. It’s just that
it’s in our blood, I guess. We can’t seem to keep
away from places where there are moving pictures
to be made. Might as well get started.
Here, have some,” and he poured out a drink of
lemonade.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we’ll have a good time, as well as some
work, if we go out there,” declared Joe. “It
won’t be as bad as you try to make out. Didn’t
we always have good times on our trips?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and strenuous times, too. I’m not
making any kick. Only if we hadn’t seen that
newspaper we could still be sitting here in the
shade, eating cherries——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Something fell with a thud on Blake’s upturned
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wow!” he cried. “I guess that robin’s getting
busy,” for a ripe, luscious cherry had fallen
from above, and Blake laughed as he popped it
into his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a good thing this isn’t a cocoanut tree,”
remarked Joe. “You wouldn’t feel so jolly if
one of those hit you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess not. Well, I s’pose we might as well
go in and tell Mr. Baker that we’re going to
leave him. We can pack up to-day, and start
West to-morrow. We’ll have to have the cameras
sent on from New York. We can order
them and a supply of film by telegraph. I guess
we could telephone the message in. That will
save a trip to town, and we haven’t much time,”
added Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There you go! Off with a rush! Telephones
and telegrams. Walking will be too slow for
you! Everything bang-up! Let her go!” cried
Blake, swinging his arms to indicate progress.
“Good-bye, vacation!” he cried. “The strenuous
life from now on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two youths arose from the grass, and
together they started for the house at which they
were boarding.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had gone only a few steps, however,
when, from across the country road, and a short
distance down it, came a hail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s that?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know—listen!” suggested Blake.
“Are they calling us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no doubt about it a moment later,
for the boys heard a voice shouting:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi there! Joe! Blake! Moving Picture
Boys! You’re wanted!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is it? I can’t see,” murmured Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Harry, the clerk in Robertson’s store,”
answered Blake, for a short distance away was
the general store—“The Universal Emporium,”
as the sign had it—of Hank Robertson, of Central
Falls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, boys!” went on the voice of the
caller, who was out of sight because of a roadside
hedge. “You’re wanted on the long-distance
telephone!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ugh!” groaned Blake. “Might have known
it. Did you start this, Joe?” and he looked at
his chum suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t know a thing about it. Who can want
us on the ’phone?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Best way’s to go and find out. Mighty queer,
though, that just as we read of the Mississippi
flood, and decide to go, someone should ring
us up on long distance. I thought we got rid of
all that when we came here for our vacation.
Things have started with a rush.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, are you comin’?” demanded the store
clerk. “Central has been ringin’ like all possessed!
Must be important!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess it is, or they wouldn’t telephone,”
murmured Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re coming!” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Together the boys hurried out into the road,
and turned down toward the store.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were not many telephones in the country
village of Central Falls. They were considered
too much of a luxury. But Hank Robertson
was rather progressive, and had had a long
distance instrument installed in his store some
time before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There you be, boys!” he said, as Joe and
Blake entered. “I knew as soon as I heard the
bell ring that it was long distance. I answered,
and sent Harry out to call you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Much obliged,” spoke Blake. “Do you
know who it is?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nope. It was Central talking. She said
either of you two was wanted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake stepped to the instrument, and took up
the receiver, which had been standing upright on
the desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello!” he called into the transmitter. Then
he was silent, but, from the look of wonder and
surprise that spread over his face as he listened,
Joe knew that it was something important, and
out of the usual.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />STIRRING NEWS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Joe could hear his chum Blake murmuring
such things as:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I’m listening! Is that so? Say, that’s
fierce!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes, I guess we can go,” spoke Blake,
after a lengthy talk from the person at the other
end of the wire. “Yes, Joe’s here with me,” he
went on. “What! Is she lost, too?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, for cats’ sake give a fellow an idea
what it’s all about; can’t you, Blake?” pleaded
Joe, at his chum’s elbow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a minute,” answered Blake, in an aside.
“I’ll give you the whole story in a minute. I
want to get it straight first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he continued to listen, and while he is
thus at the telephone I will tell my new readers,
briefly, something about the moving picture boys.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the initial volume of this series, entitled
“The Moving Picture Boys; Or, Perils of a
Great City Depicted,” I introduced Blake Stewart
and Joe Duncan. They were farm lads, and,
most unexpectedly, one day, a company of moving
picture actors and actresses came to their village
to make scenes in a rural drama. The two
boys became interested, especially in the mechanical
end of the work of making films.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later they had an opportunity of taking up
the business under the direction of Mr. Calvert
Hadley, a moving picture operator, who offered
to teach Joe and Blake how to properly use the
wonderful cameras.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys went to New York, and met the
members of the Film Theatrical Company, with
which Mr. Hadley was associated. That gave
Joe and Blake their start in life, and since then
they had been in the business of taking moving
pictures. They became experts, and their services
were in great demand, not only in filming
dramas acted by the company, but in making
independent views.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went out West, as told in the second volume,
and got some stirring views of cowboys
and Indians, and then they went to the Pacific
Coast, and later to the jungle, where there were
more strenuous times.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their latest venture had been to Earthquake
Land, and on returning from there they felt the
need of a vacation. They engaged board at the
farmhouse of Hiram Baker, in Central Falls,
about fifty miles from New York City, and they
were taking their rest there when the newspaper
story of the flood on the Mississippi, and the
long-distance telephone call, rather interrupted
their ease and quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>I might add that in their trip to the coast Joe
located his long-lost father, and later, in an expedition
to the jungle, he succeeded in locating
his sister, who had gone to the Dark Continent
as a missionary’s helper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Duncan and his daughter Jessie made their
home together, and Joe stayed with them when
he was not off with Blake making moving pictures—which
was quite often.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a time Joe and Blake had worked with
the Film Theatrical Company, which went to various
parts of the country to get the proper backgrounds
for their films. But of late, as I have
said, the two boys had started out for themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still they kept up their acquaintanceship and
friendship with the company. Just a word about
the various members, and I will resume this story.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Jacob Ringold was the proprietor of the
Film Theatrical Company, and some of the members
were Henry Robertson, who played juvenile
leads, Harris Levinberg, the “villain,” Miss
Nellie Shay, the leading lady, and Birdie Lee, a
pretty, vivacious girl, who took the lighter feminine
parts in the dramas. And there was Christopher
Cutler Piper—oh, yes, we must not forget
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Piper did not like his name—that is, the
two first sections, and his friends, to oblige him,
had shortened it to “C. C.,” or else they called
him just “Mr. Piper.” Sometimes, however, he
was referred to as “Gloomy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This name fitted him to perfection. He was
a gloomy comedian—that is, he was gloomy off
the stage; not on it. He would raise a laugh by
his action, or lines, and, coming out of the scene,
would be in the most doleful state of mind imaginable.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this book you will find many references to
“filming” a scene, exposed, unexposed and developed
films, cameras, and the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a full explanation of how moving pictures
are taken, I refer my readers to the previous
volumes of this series.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now to resume the story.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake stood there, his ear fairly glued to the
receiver, and the expression on his face constantly
changing. But, though it did change, a
certain worried look, that came over it almost
from the first moment of the spoken words, did
not leave it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, are you going to talk all day, without
giving me a hint of what it is?” spoke Joe, in a
tense whisper. “Let me listen in; can’t you, old
man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right away—yes,” answered Blake, in an
aside. “All right,” he called into the transmitter.
“Yes, I’ll tell Joe all about it. He’ll come
with me, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I rather guess I will—if I ever find out
what it’s about,” murmured the other. “Have
a heart, and tell me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye,” called Blake, into the telephone.
“I’ll see you in New York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he hung up the receiver, and, turning to
his chum, asked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think has happened?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I haven’t the least idea, unless New York is
wiped off the map by a dynamite explosion, and
we’re wanted to help put it back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, it isn’t exactly that,” said Blake. “I
was talking just now to Mr. Ringold. He’s in a
peck of trouble!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, he wants us to start for the flooded
Mississippi district at once, and get a lot of
scenes out there. But that’s not the worst. Part
of his company, that he sent out near Hannibal,
Missouri, to take part in several film dramas,
have been lost in the flood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lost in the flood?” cried Joe. “His company
of players?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. He could give me no particulars, but
he’s going to start and organize a rescue party,
and try to save them. He wants us to help with
that work, as well as to make moving pictures
for him. Some of the valuable films the company
had already taken were also lost, when they
were carried down the river.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how did it happen?” Joe wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He didn’t have time to give me many particulars
over the wire. He said he’d do that
when he met us in New York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some of our friends lost in the flood,” murmured
Joe. “I wonder if there’s a chance of
saving them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to try, anyhow,” spoke Blake,
seriously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was C. C. among them?” Joe wanted to
know, referring to the gloomy comedian.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, he’s in New York, where Mr. Ringold
also has a company at work for the movies.
C. C. escaped. But Birdie Lee went adrift with
the others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Birdie Lee!” cried Joe, for he and Blake
were both very fond of the pretty, vivacious girl,
whose pictures they had taken many times, as she
went through her parts before the camera.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only hope we can rescue her,” murmured
Blake. “It certainly is a bad bit of news.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he didn’t say how it happened?” inquired
Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All he told me,” resumed Blake, “was that
the company was performing open-air stuff near
the flooded district. How they happened to be
carried away Mr. Ringold didn’t know. It seems
that someone telegraphed him the news, that’s
how he heard of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And how did he happen to think of us, and
how did he know we were here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He says he thought of us at once—as soon as
he got the news,” went on Blake, “and he had
our address. We left it with him when we
came here, you know, but told him not to send
for us except in case of emergency.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And this sure is an emergency,” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re right,” agreed his chum. “Mr. Ringold
got busy on the telephone, and—well, you
know the rest. I told him we’d start for New
York as soon as we could pack up. He’ll meet
us there, and then we’ll head straight for the
flooded district with our cameras.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Busy times ahead,” murmured Joe. “Well,
I guess it’s all for the best, except the carrying
away of our friends. I was getting a bit tired of
this vacation life, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So was I,” admitted Blake, as they left the store
and headed for their boarding house.</p>

<p class='c008'>With quickening steps the boys walked up the
path. There was nervous energy in their every
move.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My! But you’re in a hurry on a hot day,”
observed Mrs. Baker, who had taken quite a
liking to her two young boarders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got to be!” exclaimed Blake. “We’re going
to try and catch the afternoon train for New
York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“New York! My sakes alive! You’re not
going; are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got to,” explained Joe. “I think we can
make it if we hurry. Some friends of ours are
lost in that Mississippi flood, and we’ve got to go
and help find and save them if we can. No
time to lose!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My land sakes! I never heard tell of such
a thing!” cried Mrs. Baker. But the boys did
not stop to hear her comments. They were on
their way to their rooms to pack their grips.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />MR. PIPER IS APPREHENSIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it didn’t take us long; did it, Blake?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, indeed, Joe. But we certainly have
hustled some since we got that long-distance telephone
message.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re used to hustling, though, old man.
You wouldn’t get very far with moving pictures
unless you did get a move on now and then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two chums were seated in a railway train,
on their way to New York to meet Mr. Ringold,
and do what they could to rescue the unfortunate
members of the moving picture company.
They did not know what was before them, but
they had stout hearts, and they had made up
their minds to brave any danger in order to save
their friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor Birdie Lee!” murmured Blake. “I
can’t help but think of her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Same here,” agreed Joe. “She certainly was
a dandy little chum and comrade. Always
willing to do anything that was asked, to make a
good film.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and she never found fault if someone
made a break, and we had to film the scene all
over again,” put in Blake. “Do you remember
the time she had to fall overboard, out of the
boat on the lake?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say I did remember it! C. C. Piper
was to rescue her, but he was so slow about it—so
afraid he’d get drowned, or have wet feet, or
something, that the scene was spoiled, and Birdie
had to get into dry clothes, and act the whole
thing over, taking a second plunge into the
water.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Ringold was sure mad at C. C. that
day,” laughed Blake. “But it didn’t always
happen that way. We’ve had our fun, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, sure. But we’re not likely to this time—scooting
around in the rain, on a river that’s
twice as big as it ought to be. Say, when we
get to the junction we may be able to get a New
York paper of to-day, and see how things are out
in the flooded district now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe we can,” assented Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys settled back in their seats, for the
ride of about two hours to New York, for they
were on a slow train. On receiving the news
over the wire, they had hastily packed, and amid
the expressed regrets of Mr. and Mrs. Baker at
their departure, had driven to the station.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their train made a stop at nearly every depot,
and at several, where there was a wait, Joe and
Blake got out and inquired if there were any
newspapers of that day. But none had been
received.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cliff Junction!” called out the brakeman,
and the boys prepared to change in order to take
an express train for the remainder of the journey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now for a paper!” exclaimed Blake, as he
hurried up to the news-stand. Joe followed, and
as a man, with his back turned to them, was
making a purchase, they waited until he should
have stepped aside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s always the way!” this man was complaining
in a voice at the sound of which Joe
and Blake looked at each other quickly. “Always
the way! Whenever I go anywhere the
train is sure to be late.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The express isn’t much behind,” said the
boy at the news-stand. “Only ten minutes, and
she’ll make that up before she gets to New
York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! Yes. The engineer will put on extra
steam, to make up lost time, and there’ll be a
collision, or we’ll go off the track, or through a
bridge, or something like that,” went on the man.
“I never saw such a road, anyhow! I’ll never
travel on it again. I’ve had the worst luck
to-day!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somebody stepped on my foot, the expressman
didn’t come for my baggage until I was
nearly in a fit, for fear I’d miss the train, and
now I get here and find the express late! What
a world this is, anyhow! It’s fierce.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, C. C.!” exclaimed Blake, heartily.
He did not need to see the man’s face to know
who he was.</p>

<p class='c008'>The complaining man wheeled about quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The moving picture boys!” he cried, as he
noted Joe and Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s who!” laughed Joe. “Where are
you bound for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“New York; if I ever get there. But the train
is late, and I know there’ll be a smash-up!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, having made this gloomy prediction,
Mr. C. C. Piper whistled a merry little tune, and
did a few dancing steps which he used in some
of his comic scenes. C. C.’s gloom was evidently
not deep.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I guess we’ll come out all right,” said
Joe, cheerfully. “But we heard that you were
in New York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who told you that?” demanded Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Ringold. I was talking to him over the
long-distance ’phone a little while ago,” explained
Blake. “He said you were in New York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was, but I ran up to see a friend, expecting
to spend the week-end with him. And I’d no
sooner gotten there than Ringold got me on the
telephone, and ordered me back. That was after
he talked to you, I guess. It seems some of his
company are lost in the Mississippi flood, and
he wants me to go out there with him. Some
of the dramas will have to be done over again,
as the films were lost, and he’s going to try to
find the missing folks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re on the same errand,” remarked Joe.
“Mr. Ringold cut short our vacation, too, by
long distance. We’re in the same boat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Boat? Yes!” snorted the gloomy comedian.
“And I guess we’ll have to use a boat out
on the Mississippi. We can’t wade or swim,
and there’s sure to be a lot of trouble. I wish
I’d never gone into this business! It’s awful!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it may not be so bad,” spoke Blake,
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s bound to be,” declared C. C. “Look at
it! Bad luck from the very start. Express late,
and all that. It’s fierce!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no use trying to talk him out of
his gloom, and the boys realized this. It was
best to let him work it off in his own way, and
be as cheerful as possible toward him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there any later news of the flood, in the
paper?” asked Joe. “We only read of it in
yesterday’s sheet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it’s getting worse instead of better,”
replied Mr. Piper. “I can’t get my regular
paper, though,” he complained. “Why don’t
you keep the <i>Planet</i>?” he asked, of the boy behind
the counter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did have some, sir, but they’re all gone,”
was the smiling answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! That’s just the way! Everything
goes wrong with me!” cried C. C. “I’ve a
good notion to go back and not start until to-morrow.
Something serious is bound to happen
before this day is over. I’ve a notion to go
back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I wouldn’t,” persuaded Blake. “Mr.
Ringold will be expecting you, and he will be
disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll go on; but, mark my words, something
will happen before we reach New York,”
predicted C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moving picture boys purchased newspapers,
not being particular what kind, as long
as they contained fresh news of the big flood.
They found more recent dispatches than those
they had read at the farmhouse, and other pictures.
As Mr. Piper had said, the raging Mississippi
was higher than before, and the almost
constant fall of rain, augmenting the streams
that poured into the Father of Waters, added
to the danger and desolation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anything about our friends?” asked Blake
of his chum, as the latter scanned the pages
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I don’t see any mention of them. But
it says several lives have been lost, and there
is much suffering from lack of food and clothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad! I wish we were out there now,
and could help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys, pacing up and down the depot platform,
rapidly glanced over the news sheets, and
Joe suddenly uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s something!” he cried. “There are
no names given, but in a dispatch from Hannibal
it says that it is rumored a company of
moving picture actors, and actresses, were carried
away in a house that was swept down by
the current.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s our crowd, all right,” declared Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No mention of Birdie Lee; is there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not any names given. Say, I wish that
express would come along, and get us to New
York! I’m in a hurry to find out how much
Mr. Ringold knows.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So am I,” added Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll never get to New York without an
accident,” declared the gloomy C. C. “I’m positive
of it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>However, at that moment the whistle of the
approaching express train was heard, and there
was a hurried movement among the waiting passengers.
The moving picture boys and Mr. Piper
kept together, and got seats by themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’re making time now, all right,” Joe
said, as they whizzed along. “Making up some
of those lost ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Um! Yes! Wait and see what happens,”
predicted C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>But nothing did, at least up to the time when
the train pulled into the One Hundred and
Twenty-fifth street station of the New York
Central. The next stop would be the Grand Central
Terminal, in the heart of New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got a minute,” remarked Joe, to his
chum. “Let’s see if we can get a still later
paper. Maybe there’s an extra out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m with you,” agreed Blake, as they left
the train. Mr. Piper seemed sad, that his apprehensions
of an accident had not been borne out.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Blake and Joe were looking for a newsboy,
they became aware of a commotion in the street
below them, the tracks here being elevated.
There was a clanging of bells, and much shouting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something doing down there,” remarked
Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it’s a fire!” cried Joe, as he caught a
lurid reflection in the evening sky. “Looks like
a big one, too. Shall we take it in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Might as well. We can come down on a
later train, and telephone Mr. Ringold. And
say, you’ve got that little moving picture camera
with you; haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I brought it along. Wasn’t room to
put it in the trunk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then come on. We’ll get some views of
this fire. We can use them nicely, and it isn’t
likely that there’ll be anyone else on the job.
Come on and get the camera.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can’t! The train’s already started!”
cried Joe, for the express was slowly moving.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we can! I’ll get it!” shouted Blake,
as he sprang into the car where they had left
their baggage. The train was now rapidly gathering
headway, the whine and hum of the big
motors of the electric engine mingling with the
clang of the fire bells, and the shouts of the
crowd in the streets below.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />OFF FOR THE FLOOD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Here, where are you going?” cried a station-attendant,
as he saw Blake running to board
the moving train.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forgot something—got to get it!” shouted
the excited lad. Then, before the man could prevent
him, Blake had jumped up the steps. Back
he rushed to where his own and Joe’s baggage
had been left.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look after our stuff, C. C.!” he called to
the startled comedian. “We’re after a fire—moving
picture. Tell Mr. Ringold we’ll be down
later this evening!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, without giving Mr. Piper a chance to
answer, Blake caught up the valise containing
the small moving picture camera, and was out
on the platform again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out for yourself!” cried Joe, for the
train now had considerable headway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” answered his chum, and a moment
later he was beside Joe, running from the
momentum acquired in leaping off the train.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You took a big risk, young fellow!” said
one of the station men, severely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m used to that in my business,” replied
Blake, with a cool laugh. “Come on, Joe. We
don’t want to miss any of this fire. We can sell
the film to one of the weekly newspapers, and
make some of our vacation money.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go on! I’m with you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Together they made their way down to the
street, and it needed but a glance to show them
the extent of the blaze. The fire was in a large
apartment house, and the flames had gained great
headway. Thrilling rescue scenes were going
on, and, from some of the upper stories, men
and women were dropping into the life nets,
about which, in a circle, stood the sturdy firemen,
and volunteer helpers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got to get this!” cried Blake. “Is there
plenty of film in her, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think so. But I’ll get more. There’s a
photo-supply house about three blocks away.
You start grinding away at the crank, and I’ll
chase down there and get another reel of film in
case we want it. I guess they’ll be open yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” answered Blake, with a nod.
Then he looked for a vantage point from which
to make pictures of the big fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>He decided to stand on a square pillar, near
the steps of a building nearly opposite the burning
structure, and, slipping under the rope which
the police had stretched as the limits of the fire
lines, Blake was about to set up his machine
when a man, also bearing a moving picture camera,
made for the same place. It was really
about the only spot where a good picture could
be taken, but there was room for only one operator
there.</p>

<p class='c008'>The opposite pillar, or pedestal, was occupied
by a portable searchlight, operated by some firemen,
to aid their comrades in the work of rescue
and fighting the flames, and the brilliant, white
light being flashed on the burning structure made
it possible to get a good moving picture film. So
Blake was anxious to reach this place of vantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was about to start his machine, when the
man, who had reached the spot just too late,
cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, kid, come down out of there! That’s
my place!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yours?” cried Blake, as he noted that the
man was James Munson, a rival moving picture
operator, and one with whom Blake and Joe had
had trouble before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, mine!” sneered Munson. “I was here
a minute ago, and decided on that place, and
now I want it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you’re not going to get it!” declared
Blake, firmly. “If you were here you should
have stayed,” and the young operator started the
mechanism of his apparatus, by turning the
handle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had to leave, to get some extra film!”
Munson cried. “I want you to come away—come
down and let me get up there!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing doing,” spoke Blake. “You should
have left your machine here, to show that the
pedestal was occupied. I don’t believe you were
here, and as I’m here first I’m going to stay!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you are; eh? We’ll see about that!”
cried Munson, as he worked his way through the
crowd, carrying his camera with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake thought little more about the fellow, for
he was too much occupied in getting views of
the burning building, and the thrilling rescues
that were made from time to time. Firemen
went rapidly up, from window to window, by
means of the hooked scaling ladders, leaping
into the burning building in search of persons
in danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other firemen carried down unconscious
forms, and still others were engaged in the less
spectacular work of handling the hose, with its
powerful streams of water.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these scenes Blake was getting on the sensitive
celluloid film, and he was congratulating
himself on his success, when a voice in authority
called to him:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, young fellow, have you got a fire badge,
or permit?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, no,” answered Blake, slowly, as he
continued to grind away at the crank. “I left
it home, I guess.” He and Joe both had permits,
entitling them to go within the fire lines,
but they had not taken them away on their vacation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll have to come down out of that,” went
on the voice of the policeman who had challenged
Blake. And the youth, looking down, saw, beside
the guardian of the peace, the mean, sneering
face of Munson. It was he, evidently, who
had suggested to the police officer that he oust
Blake from his place.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t you overlook it this once?” asked
Blake, eagerly, for the fire was getting worse
now, and he knew it would show up well on the
films. If he had to leave his place he could not
get another as good, and would miss some thrilling scenes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on down!” ordered the officer. “You
can’t stay there without a badge, or a permit, and
and you haven’t got either. Get down, I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold on, Flarity,” spoke a new voice. “I’ll
lend him my badge. You know me; don’t you?”
and there stepped forward a young fellow whom
Blake recognized as a newspaper reporter, to
whom he had often given pictures of accidents,
for the journal he represented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Kennedy, if you let him take your
badge, I guess it will be all right,” said the
officer to the reporter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, that’s mighty good of you!” cried
Blake, as the newspaper man passed up the metal
badge that entitled the wearer to go within the
fire lines, “but what will you do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I guess Flarity won’t put me out,” said
the reporter, with a laugh. “If he does, I know
something about him——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get on with you!” interrupted the officer,
hastily, and with a rather embarrassed smile.
“I’ll look the other way, Kennedy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought you would,” laughed the reporter.
“Now you’re all right, Blake,” and he nodded,
in a friendly fashion, at the moving picture boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Munson’s plan had failed, and he moved away
to look for another place whence he could film
the fire. He cast an ugly look at Blake as he
went, though, and muttered to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry I had to do this,” thought Blake,
“but I wasn’t going to pass up a chance like this.
Munson may make trouble for us, though. He’s
got a revengeful disposition. But if Joe and I
go out to the flooded district probably we shan’t
see him for some time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If Blake had really known the depth of the
resentment Munson cherished against him, from
that moment, he might have given in to the fellow.
Had he done so it would have saved much
trouble for himself and Joe later. But he could
not foretell the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake continued to take pictures of the fire,
and he was beginning to think his film would
run out, when Joe came up with a fresh reel.
The policeman had gone away, and there was
now so much excitement about the fire that no
one minded whether Joe had a badge or not. He
relieved Blake at the camera.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the blaze, big as it was, finally yielded to
the work of the firemen, and at length all the
persons had been gotten out of the apartment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess we’ve got enough,” said Blake,
finally. “Now we’ll hustle this to the laboratory,
Joe, have it developed, and see what use
we can make of it. I’ll get some of the weeklies
on the ’phone, and see how many prints they
want.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake and Joe, as those of you know who have
read the other books of this series, had their
own establishment in New York, where they developed
and printed their films.</p>

<p class='c008'>What Blake meant by “weeklies” was a certain
feature much used in moving picture houses.
Important current events of the week, big accidents,
volcanic eruptions, war scenes—in fact,
anything in which the public is interested—are
registered on the sensitive celluloid, and sent
around to the theaters which take the service
of the weekly film. It is, in brief, a moving
picture newspaper, and our two heroes had made
considerable money in the past in supplying films
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later the film of the fire was being
developed, ready for printing, and Blake had secured,
over the telephone, a number of orders.
These were turned over to their assistants, for
the two youths could not do all the work themselves,
and had a number of employees.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, now that’s done,” said Joe, with a sigh
of satisfaction. “We’d better be getting down
to see Mr. Ringold, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” agreed Blake, looking at his watch.
“And I want something to eat, too. It’s past
ten o’clock, and we haven’t had supper yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right!” cried Joe. “I forgot all
about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My stomach didn’t,” laughed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour later, after a hasty meal, they reached
the office of Mr. Ringold, whom they found talking
to Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was just going to telephone around, and
get the police on your trail,” said the gloomy
comedian. “I was afraid something had happened
to you. Did there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, nothing much,” spoke Joe, with a smile.
“But what is the news, Mr. Ringold? Have
you heard any word from any of your people in
the flooded district?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I haven’t, I’m sorry to say, though I’ve
tried all the means in my power. It is almost
impossible to get messages through, and receive
a reply. The wires are nearly all down. The
only way is for us to go out there. I’m glad
you boys came on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We started as soon as we could,” explained
Blake. “I guess Mr. Piper told you how we
stopped to film the fire; didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” replied the film theatrical manager.
“And now, how soon can you start for the
flooded district?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just as soon as we can get our cameras
ready, and provide for a supply of film—in the
morning,” answered Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good! Then we’ll start. We’ve got hard
work and some danger ahead of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re used to that—especially the danger,”
remarked Joe. “I guess it won’t be much worse
than it was in earthquake land.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should hope not!” murmured Mr. Piper.
“I don’t like this idea at all. I’m sure something
is going to happen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re nervous!” cried Mr. Ringold, “and
I don’t blame you, either. This news has gotten
on my nerves. When I think of how my friends
may be suffering, it makes me wild to get out
there, and help them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Same here!” exclaimed Blake, and I think
he and Joe had a similar thought then, and the
same memory of a pretty, blue-eyed girl—Birdie
Lee.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two moving picture boys spent several
hours getting their cameras and equipment ready
for the start the next morning, and when they
tumbled into bed they “didn’t need to be sung
to sleep,” as Blake put it.</p>

<p class='c008'>As several of the completed films of the Western
dramas had been lost in the flood, Mr. Ringold
decided to have others made, and to accomplish
this he would have to hire more players.
But he thought he could engage them in the
West, and so, save for a few leading characters,
like Mr. Piper, he took only a few actors and
actresses with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’re off,” murmured Joe, as, the
next day, he and Blake took their places in the
train that was to bear them to the West, and
the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we’re off, and there’s no telling what
may happen before we get back,” answered his
chum, seriously.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />THE RELIEF TRAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“What are your plans, Mr. Ringold?” asked
Blake, as he and his chum, with C. C., sat in
the Pullman car, talking over the situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I really haven’t had time to make any very
definite ones,” answered the manager. “I’m
taking out a supply of money, I don’t mind saying
that,” he went on, and Mr. Piper suddenly
gave a quick look about the coach, and uttered
a stagy hiss, as a caution to be silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s up now?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think it’s wise to speak so plainly
about money,” replied the gloomy comedian.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might be robbed, Mr. Ringold.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you see any suspicious characters following
us?” the manager wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I wouldn’t say they were exactly suspicious,”
went on the actor, “but I did see two
men hanging around us when we were having
our baggage checked in the depot. They seemed
very anxious to know where we were going.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that so?” asked Mr. Ringold, and he
seemed unusually interested. “What sort of
looking chaps were they?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The actor described them. Blake and Joe
looked at each other quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t seem to recognize them as friends of
mine,” went on the manager, musingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say not!” cried Blake. “Certainly
not friends! Say, I’m sure those men were
James Munson, and one of his tools, Jake Black.
They made a lot of trouble for us, and at the
fire, last night, Munson and I had an argument.
Do you think they can be following us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s just as well to be on the safe side,” said
Mr. Ringold. “Suppose you boys take a look
through the train, and see if you can pick them
out. I don’t like the idea of being followed by
a rival moving picture man, when I may have a
chance to get some exclusive and valuable films.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake and Joe each went through half the
train, but they saw no signs of Munson, or his
crony. The boys even penetrated to the smoking
car, where the two suspects would probably
stay, but they were not there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“False alarm, I guess,” reported Blake, when
he and Joe had completed their search.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, they were hanging around, all right,”
declared the sad actor, “though they may not
be here now. But, just the same, I wouldn’t
mention about having so much money—not in
public. Something might happen, Mr. Ringold.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think there is little danger. I have only
a small part of it in cash. The rest is in letters
of credit, that are only good when I have signed
them. I’m not worrying.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But as to plans. The only thing I see to do
is to go direct to Hannibal, and see if we can
get on the trail of the missing ones there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That does seem to be about the only thing
to do,” agreed Blake. “I wish we were there
now. It’s maddening to know you’ve got a lot
to do, and not be able to do it. I want action!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so do I!” cried his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, there was nothing for it but to wait
until they reached the flooded district. On and
on sped their train, making but few stops. When
they did reach a large city, the boys would go
out and buy the latest papers, to get news of the
flood along the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reports were not reassuring. The rains
still continued at intervals, and the rivers, not
only the Mississippi, but tributary streams also,
were rising, which added to the swollen condition
of the big waterway.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pitiful tales of suffering of men, women and
children began to filter in, and it was reported
that relief measures were being undertaken by
the various states. In some places the National
Guard was being ordered out, to aid in rescue
work, and several detachments of the Regulars
had been sent to the flooded districts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first day and night passed without incident
to our friends speeding to the West. No
trace was seen of Munson, or any of his tools,
and it was certain that if he had not boarded
the train in New York, at which station the actor
said he had seen him, the rival was behind, and
not ahead of our friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter, Blake?” asked Mr. Ringold,
on the second day out. “Are you restless?”
for the youth was pacing up and down
the aisle of the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I am, Mr. Ringold,” he answered. “I
wish I had something to film. I’m tired sitting
around.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You didn’t mind it when we were out in the
country,” remarked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but then we were on a vacation, and we
were entitled to a rest. But now we’re back on
the job again, and I want action. I almost wish
something would happen, to give me a chance to
make a film.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t say that! Don’t say that!” cried Mr.
Piper, with upraised hand. “Don’t wish for
anything to happen, or it may. This train is
going very fast, and there may be a smash-up
any minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hardly had he spoken, than there sounded the
sudden application of the air brakes. The wheels
groaned and whined under the pressure, and the
train came to a quick stop.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There!” cried the gloomy comedian. “What
did I tell you? That’s what you get for wishing
for an accident!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I didn’t wish for one,” replied Blake, quickly,
as he reached for the carrier containing his moving
picture camera, “and I don’t believe it is an
accident. Anyhow, nothing has happened to us,”
he added. “But I’m going to see what it is.
Come on, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The two boys, as well as Mr. Ringold, the
actor, and several other passengers, hurried from
the car, as the train had now come to a full stop.
And what Blake and Joe saw was a danger signal
set against the train, on the approach to a
long bridge that spanned a turbulent stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?” asked Joe, of a trainman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bridge is weakened by high water,” was the
answer. “The bridge-tender must have discovered
it suddenly, for he flashed down the signal
against us in a hurry. The engineer had to put
on the emergency air, in order to stop in time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They all walked forward along the track to the
first span of the bridge. It looked to be all
right, but the rushing, muddy water that flowed
beneath it was close to the ties and rails.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think one of the piers is weakened a little,”
said the bridge-tender. “And if the water rises
much more she’ll tear away, sure. I’ve sent for
the repair gang. They’re only five miles away,
and they may be able to brace it temporarily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we’ll be delayed?” asked Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid so,” answered the conductor. “I
can’t take any chances with this train on a weak
bridge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course he was right, but everyone fretted
over the delay, especially our friends, who
wanted to start their rescue work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ve got something to film, anyhow!”
cried Blake. “I’ll make pictures showing the
repairs to the bridge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The construction and wrecking crews were
soon on hand, and a careful examination disclosed
the fact that the bridge had been slightly
weakened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we can brace her temporarily—that is,
unless the water rises suddenly,” said the foreman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our first taste of the flood,” murmured
Blake, as he and Joe set up the camera to make
moving pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys were much interested in the work of
strengthening the bridge, and got some good
views of it. The work took several hours, but
was finally completed enough for the train to
proceed slowly—in two sections.</p>

<p class='c008'>The locomotive took over part of the cars,
shunted them to a switch, and then pulled over
the remainder. The train was then made up
again, and proceeded. But considerable time
had been lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>The night passed without incident, and on arriving
at the junction point, a large city, where
they were to change trains, the boys found a
further chance to make films.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s going on?” asked Blake, as he saw,
in the depot, a number of soldiers boarding the
cars. Boxes, bales and barrels were also being
rushed into baggage and express cars.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One of the relief trains, for the flood victims,”
said a depot attendant. “They’re rushing
food and supplies to the homeless ones, and the
soldiers are going to help in the rescue work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“More pictures, Joe!” cried Blake. “We’ve
got time before our train leaves to make a short
film of this rescue train.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />THE MISSING FILMS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Lively and varied were the scenes about the
relief train. Wagons were constantly being
driven up to the station, loaded with supplies
that had been contributed by generous merchants,
or bought with public subscriptions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The soldiers wore serious faces, for it was reported,
in a few of the large cities, that rioting
and robbery had followed the trail of the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’d just like to get my hands on some
of those human fiends who’ll rob at a time like
this!” exclaimed a big trooper, as he banged his
gun down on the platform. “I’d show him
what’s what!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right!” chimed in his comrades.</p>

<p class='c008'>More soldiers kept arriving. They were
mostly National Guardsmen, though one company
of Regulars was on the train.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some doctors were being taken along, and a
quantity of medical stores, for sickness had
broken out, it was reported. A large supply of
tents was being shipped, for many of the sufferers
had been driven from home by high water,
had been forced to flee to the hills, where they
were camping in the open. And tents were
much needed for shelter, for, though it was Summer,
there was considerable rain, and this made
it very uncomfortable for the refugees, especially
the women and children, to stay out unprotected.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these scenes Joe and Blake took with
their moving picture camera. Now and then
they moved up or down the big depot, to get
varied views. Sometimes they would film a pathetic
scene, as when a little girl, who had evidently
read about the relief subscriptions,
brought her bank filled with pennies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, Mr. Soldier-man,” she said, to a
bearded Regular. “I’ve got a dollar an’ nineteen
cents saved up, and I want you to take it
and buy some little girl a pair of rubber boots,
so she can wade in the water, and not get
drowned.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” cried the soldier, as he wiped
away something that glistened in his eyes, and
blew his nose unnecessarily hard, it seemed.
“All right, little one. I’ll take care of your
money for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And don’t forget to buy the boots!” cried
the tot, shaking her finger at him to impress it
on his mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t,” he promised, and as he stood looking
at the penny-bank, rather uncertain what to
do with it, Blake filmed him, as a conclusion of
the little scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if I oughtn’t to make the kid take
back this money?” the soldier said, speaking to
the boys. “Maybe her folks wouldn’t like her
to give it away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess they wouldn’t mind,” remarked
Blake, with a smile. “Anyhow, she’s gone
now,” for she had quickly slipped away in the
throng.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what am I to do with the stuff?” asked
the bewildered trooper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Turn it over to some of the ladies,” suggested
Joe, for a committee of Red Cross women
were to go with the relief train.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I will,” the man said, with an air of
relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a dog who refused to be separated
from his soldier-master, and every time the animal
was put out of the depot it came rushing
back again, determined to board the train. The
boys got a picture of this odd little scene, and
finally the dog had to be given in charge of a
porter, to be led away at the end of a rope,
howling his protest at the separation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good work, boys!” complimented Mr. Ringold,
when he saw what they were doing. “I’ll
use some of these films as part of one of the
flood dramas, if we’re lucky enough to be able
to get other scenes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we’ll get some!” declared Blake, confidently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That ought to be a fine one,” went on the
manager, referring to the relief train scene.
“Take good care of that film, boys.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was placed in a metal light-tight box, to be
developed later, as was the film of repairing the
bridge. Blake and Joe intended leaving them
at an agency they knew of, farther West, there
to be developed, and printed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All aboard!” called the conductor of the relief
train, and there was the last scurrying and
hurrying to finish up the work. This train pulled
out ahead of the one the boys and their friends
were to take, and it had the right of way, for
help was now urgently needed in the flooded
district.</p>

<p class='c008'>Progress from then on, for those who were
seeking the lost actors and actresses, was rather
slow and uncertain. They were now on the edge
of the flooded district, and, though they saw no
scenes of actual suffering, as yet, they were held
up by such happenings as bridges washed away,
or made unsafe, tracks undermined by the rain,
and landslides covering the rails.</p>

<p class='c008'>So they were two days longer on the road
than otherwise they would have been. Relief
trains, too, had the right of way, and even the
regular passenger trains were held back, or
switched to other tracks, while the cars laden
with soldiers and supplies were rushed forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ringold fretted and fumed at the delay,
but there was no help for it. Those suffering
must be cared for first.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We ought to be at Hannibal to-morrow,”
said the manager, one night, as the sleeping
berths were being made up. “Then we can start
in, and do something. I only hope we can find
them,” he added, referring to his lost company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe and Blake had sections opposite each
other, and, after talking across the aisle in low
tones for a few minutes, they dropped off to
sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was past midnight when Blake thought he
felt someone fumbling at the curtains of his
berth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That you, Joe?” he asked, sleepily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” inquired his chum, evidently
also just awakened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I asked if that was you at my berth just
now,” repeated Blake. “I’m sure I felt someone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So did I. I thought it was you,” said Joe.
“Were you up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit of it! Say, maybe we’d better
look around a bit. The films are under my
berth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake slipped on a bathrobe over his pajamas,
and got out in the aisle. The narrow, curtained
passage contained no one. Joe thrust his head
out between his curtains, to watch Blake as he
felt under the berth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Joe, they’re gone!” cried the young operator,
as he faced about. “The cases containing
the relief train and bridge films are gone!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Positive. I left them right between my two
valises, and they’re not there now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe the porter took them by mistake,”
suggested Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll ring and find out,” declared Blake, as
he pushed the button in his berth.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sleepy colored man shuffled out from the
end of the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Ju ring, sah?” he yawned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” exclaimed Blake. “Did you take anything
from under my berth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yais, sah. Ah done tuck yo’ all shoes jest
now, fo’ to shine ’em. I allers does dat ’long
’bout dish yeah time. I done tuck dat gen’man’s
shoes, too,” and he nodded at Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you just take them?” Blake wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yais, sah. ’Long ’bout two er free minutes
ago. Didn’t yo’ all want me to?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Blake, as a puzzled
look came over his face. “Then it was you
who woke me up—taking my shoes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah’s mighty sorry, sah,” spoke the porter,
as he saw a vanishing vision of a tip. “Ah
didn’t go fo’ t’ do it, sah!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t mind about that,” said Blake, “but
there are some films missing from under my
berth. Did you see, or take them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Deed an’ Ah didn’t, boss!” was the quick
reply. “Ah ain’t got no use fo’ movin’ picture
films, ’deed an’ Ah ain’t!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man was evidently honest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then they must have been taken earlier in
the night,” said Blake, slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By whom?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s only one person I suspect—Munson.
He must be on our trail, and that means trouble,
Joe,” spoke Blake, soberly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />STALLED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“What’s going on?” asked Mr. Ringold,
who had been awakened in his berth, near the
two boys, by hearing the talk. “Has any thing
happened?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There certainly has,” replied Blake, taking
care not to speak too loudly, for fear of awakening
the other passengers. “Our undeveloped
films have been stolen—the ones showing the relief
train, and the bridge work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stolen!” exclaimed the manager, thrusting
his head out from between the curtains.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, they’re gone, and that’s the only way I
can account for it,” went on Blake, as he told the
story, the colored porter standing by, and listening
with open mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We haven’t made any stops since you put the
films under your berth; have we?” asked Mr.
Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sah, dish yeah train ain’t done made no
stops since dark,” answered the porter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then the thief must be aboard still!” cried
the manager. “We must find him. It’s probably
Munson, just as you suspect. Wait until I
get some clothes on, and we’ll search.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not an easy matter to look for Munson
aboard a train consisting mostly of sleeping cars,
the occupants of which had, in the main, retired.
But when the urgency of the matter was explained
to the conductor, he lent his aid, and by
questioning the porters and brakemen, and such
passengers as were aroused, it was learned that
no one answering Munson’s description had been
seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course it may not have been he,” said
Blake, when the fruitless search was over, “and,
if it was, he may have jumped from the train.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He could have done that,” the conductor admitted.
“We struck a pretty stiff grade not long
ago and had to reduce speed. He could have
jumped off, if he hit the right place, with little
chance of injury.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing more could be done, and, regretting
the loss of the valuable films, Blake, Joe and the
others returned to their berths.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll wire all the agencies and warn them
against buying those films,” said Mr. Ringold.
“That may help some. And I’ll get a detective
agency after Munson. Those pictures are too
valuable to lose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Breakfast was eaten aboard the train just before
coming into Hannibal, and at the first stop
Ringold sent off his telegrams. A more complete
search of the train, by daylight, failed to
disclose Munson, or any suspicious characters
whom he might have engaged to trail our friends,
and steal from them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ll be there soon, now,” Joe said, as
he rose from the table in the dining car. “We’d
better get our things together, Blake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right. Say, it’s raining again!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So it is!” agreed Joe, looking out of the car
window. “This is fierce! Isn’t it ever going to
let up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>It had rained at intervals for the last two
days, and that fact, coupled with the knowledge
that it had been pouring more or less steadily
before that, did not give much assurance that the
flood would soon abate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Mississippi will be higher than ever,”
murmured Blake. “It’s going to make it bad
all around—bad for us and bad for those who are
lost. We’ll have hard work finding them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll never find them,” broke in the gloomy
voice of C. C. Piper. “They are gone forever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The faces of Blake and Joe, no less than that
of Mr. Ringold, were grave. There were grown
men and women in the party of players reported
as being lost, but the two boys thought most of
Miss Birdie Lee. It was almost as though their
own sister were lost, so near and dear did they
feel toward the little actress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rain, rain, and still more rain! The big drops
splashed on the car windows, and on either side
of the track were to be seen wet and sodden fields,
many of them almost out of sight under sheets of
water. They passed through miles of dripping
forest, to come out perhaps near the bank of
some stream that was filled to overflowing. Once
the tracks were partly under water, at a point
where a small river had overflowed the banks,
and the engineer had to slow down for fear of
spreading rails.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a dreary outlook, and when they stopped
at a station where they could get newspapers,
the printed reports of the flood were most alarming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t it ever going to let up raining?” asked
Blake, as he wiped the moisture from a window
and looked out for a possible sign of a break in
the clouds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’ll rain for forty days—or longer,” said
Christopher Cutler Piper, in still more gloomy
tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>A passenger in the seat ahead of the comedian
turned around, gave one look at the actor, and
then, taking a bottle from his valise gravely offered
it to C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here,” he said, “take some of this. It will
do you good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hey! What is it?” asked the comedian,
suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Liver medicine,” went on the passenger, who
looked as though he might be a country doctor.
“I know what’s the matter with you. You’ve
got liver complaint. I’ve had it, and I know just
how mean it makes you feel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there’s nothing the matter with my
liver!” protested the actor. “Nothing at all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t tell me! I know better!” declared the
other, with emphasis. “I put this medicine up
myself, and it’s the greatest liver regulator and
revivifier in the world. One dose will make you
feel like a new man, and two will almost cure
you. I won’t charge you anything for it, either.
I hate to see anyone suffer as you do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t suffer,” cried Mr. Piper, at a
loss to understand the other’s queer action. The
actor looked around as though for help, in case
the man should become violent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t suffer!” the country doctor cried.
“Why, you have the worst complaint in the
world. You’re a pessimist!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Huh!” grunted C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re always looking on the dark side of
things,” went on the doctor, “and that shows
your liver is affected. One bottle of my celebrated
revivifier will make you look at things
through rose-colored spectacles. Don’t take my
word for it, though. Take the medicine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” agreed Mr. Piper, while the boys
and Mr. Ringold smiled in appreciation of the
joke. “I’ll take some later,” and he laid the
bottle aside. The doctor turned away, apparently
satisfied, and a little later Mr. Piper began
telling to Joe and Blake one of the many humorous
stories for which he had been famous
while on the vaudeville stage, before taking up
moving picture work.</p>

<p class='c008'>He brought the tale to an end, amid laughter
from the boys, and the doctor, hearing, turned
around.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s more like it,” he said, casting a glance
of approval at C. C. Piper. “I knew you’d feel
happier after one dose of my liver revivifier.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I didn’t take it!” said the actor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Though I’m going to!” he added quickly, as
he noted the look on the other’s face. “I’m
sure it’s good,” he said, and then, when Blake
told the medical man that it was only C. C.
Piper’s invariable habit to look on the gloomy
side, even while cracking a joke, the patentee of
the revivifier shook his head in a puzzled fashion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Queerest case I ever heard of,” he said. He
went several seats up in the car after that, as
though he were afraid C. C. might, in a fit of
sudden despair, do him some injury.</p>

<p class='c008'>This little incident served to somewhat enliven
a day that had begun gloomily enough, and which
seemed as though it would continue so, for the
rain showed no signs of stopping.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s lucky we brought along rubber boots and
our rain-coats,” remarked Blake, as he and Joe
were gathering their baggage and cameras together,
preparatory to leaving the train, which
would soon arrive in Hannibal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we’ll need ’em all right,” agreed his
chum. “And say, we’re going to have trouble
getting pictures if this downpour keeps up. We’ll
get nothing but blurs on the films.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it’s bound to let up some time,” spoke
Blake, hopefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>The train had been proceeding slowly for some
time now. The tracks ran along the river, occasional
glimpses of which could be had.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at that!” suddenly cried Joe, as the
train rounded a curve, giving the best view yet
had, of the flooded Mississippi. “Say, that’s
some water, all right!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say yes!” exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys looked out on a big stretch of muddy
water, in which numerous trees, and other debris,
could be seen floating. The current seemed sluggish
enough, though doubtless it moved with
considerable power. Now and then small
buildings could be noted in the yellow water,
having been carried down from some farms further
up stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There goes a house!” exclaimed Mr. Ringold,
who was at the adjoining window. “Say
boys, this surely is serious!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The house, a small one, was turning slowly
about in the current.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, I wish we could get some pictures,”
murmured Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll have enough chance to get them later,”
spoke a brakeman, going through the car. “You
haven’t begun to see things yet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are they very bad?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so! I doubt if we can get in.
The river has gone up two feet since yesterday,
and it’s still rising.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean we won’t get into Hannibal?”
asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s about it. I don’t see how we’re going
on much farther. The track just ahead of us was
on the edge of the water last night, so I heard,
and it’s bound to be covered now. There are a
couple of bridges, too, that were in danger of
being washed away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knew it! I knew something would happen!”
cried Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, hadn’t you better take some of that liver
regulator?” asked Mr. Ringold, with a smile at
the comedian.</p>

<p class='c008'>The train, which had been proceeding more
and more slowly, now came to a stop. The passengers
glanced uneasily about, and Joe and Blake
hurried out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any accident?” Joe asked, of the brakeman
who had spoken of the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; at least not to the train. We’re stuck,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stuck?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, stalled! We can’t go any farther.” He
pointed ahead, to where the line swept around a
curve, and at the bend stood a man with a red
flag.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, let’s see what it is,” proposed Blake.
He and his chum ran to where the flagman stood,
and, as they rounded the curve, they saw ahead
of them a break in the line, where a bridge had
been swept away. The train could go no farther.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at that river!” cried Joe, pointing to
the big stream. It was not the Mississippi, but a
side stream, swollen by the heavy rain, and it
was adding its waters to those of the big river.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was scarcely any sound to be heard, save
the splatter of the rain, the river not rushing
along with a roar, as flooded streams sometimes
do. But that there was terrible power in this
silent current could not be doubted. And much
debris was being carried along in the muddy
waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” asked Mr. Ringold, as he came
up to join the boys. They pointed to where the
bridge had been swept away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ll have to get a boat, to take us off
to Hannibal, I guess,” said the manager, always
practical in an emergency. “Can we get one
around here?” he asked of the flagman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The railroad has sent for a tug to take the
passengers on to the city,” the man answered.
“I expect she’ll be here soon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, we’ll get our stuff together,” said
Mr. Ringold. “I’m anxious to get to the city
and make some inquiries for the lost ones.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />THE MOTOR BOAT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“There she comes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And see! It’s all she can do to stem the current!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe and Blake were watching the approach of
a small steam tug, that was coming up the stream.
Powerful as she looked, it was all she could do
to make headway, so forceful was the swollen
river.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can’t all get aboard her,” declared Mr.
Piper, who, with the boys, Mr. Ringold, and some
others, was standing in the rain, near the abutments
of the vanished bridge. “If we try to
she’ll sink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, please don’t talk that way!” begged the
manager. “We are going to have troubles
enough, without that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, all right. But I just want to be careful,”
spoke C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The boat will make several trips—there will
be no danger,” said the train conductor. “The
railroad will look after its passengers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was reassuring, but still the danger was
great. Now that the moving picture boys were
actually at the scene of the flood they realized,
better than any printed account, or any pictures,
could convey to them, how great was the desolation.
It seemed as though a little higher rise
in the river would flood the whole country.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I will abandon my idea of trying to
make any dramatic pictures,” said Mr. Ringold,
thoughtfully, as he and the boys watched the
approach of the tug. “We will devote our energies
to finding the missing members of my company,
and in making scenes of the flood. It
would be out of the question to try and make
dramas. I can see that now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake and Joe had begun to think so themselves,
and they were glad to have the manager
admit this.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re going to have all we can do, just getting
pictures under these conditions,” declared
Blake. “We’ll have to be swimming, or in a
boat, all the while, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ringold went back to the stalled train to
tell the few actors and actresses, whom he had
brought from New York with him, that no
dramas would be taken. He offered to send them
back, or to look after them in Hannibal, until he
returned, but the players decided to go back.
They could do nothing in the flooded district.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I suppose you’ll go back with the others,
C. C.,” remarked the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everyone was unprepared for the gloomy
comedian’s answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I’ll stick with you and the boys,” he
said, quietly. “I may be able to help you in the
rescue work. I’d give a good deal to be able to
find them; especially little Birdie Lee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shake!” cried Mr. Ringold, clasping Mr.
Piper’s hand. “I guess there’s nothing the matter
with your liver, after all!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a freight shed near where the
train was stalled, and under this those passengers
who were not going back, stood, while waiting
for the tug to make a landing.</p>

<p class='c008'>It rained steadily, sometimes coming down in
a veritable deluge, and again only drizzling. It
was a wet, miserable time for all, but Blake and
Joe did not murmur. Their only regret was
that the weather conditions were such as to prevent
them from using their cameras.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it may clear up to-morrow,” spoke
Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope so,” joined in Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His liver is still good,” murmured Joe.
“Otherwise he’d have said that it would never
clear. He isn’t so bad—at times.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not at times,” admitted Blake, with a
grin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The abutment on which one end of the bridge
had rested, served as a pier for the boat, which
was, after some difficulty, made fast to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All aboard,” called the captain. “We’ll
take as many as we can, and come back for the
rest. It isn’t a very long trip, nor is it an easy
one. All aboard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To the delight of Mr. Ringold, he, the boys
and Mr. Piper were among the first selected to
go. The train conductor had intimated to the
boat captain that the manager was anxious to
start on a search for missing members of his
company who had been in Hannibal.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll do all we can for you,” the captain
promised. “It’s a terrible time, and it’s going to
be worse. I don’t say that to alarm you, but so
that you may know what you have to face.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” spoke the manager. “I realize
that it isn’t going to be easy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The stream, up which the boat had come was
not, ordinarily, navigable by such large boats, but
the rising waters had turned it from hardly more
than a brook into a raging river, pouring into the
Mississippi itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some power to this current,” remarked Joe,
as he and Blake, having stowed aboard their
baggage and cameras, stood at the rail, looking
over the side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait until you get on the Mississippi,” remarked
a deck hand. “Then you’ll see some
water.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the boys did. As they emerged around a
bend in the high banks, they had a good view of
the Father of Waters as it swept on. It was almost
terrifying, and the tug, though extra steam
was put on, was barely able to make headway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s getting worse every minute!” the captain
murmured. “I don’t know what we’ll do if
this keeps on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not far, from where the train was
stalled, to Hannibal, but the tug was over an hour
in making it. The lower part of the town near
the river bottom, was under water, but the residential
section had, so far, escaped, being built
back on high ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I’ll go back after the others,” said the
captain, when he had made a landing, not without
some difficulty, at a temporary dock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we’ll see if we can get into a hotel,” suggested
Mr. Ringold, “though I guess most of
them will be over-crowded.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was found to be the case. Many persons
had been driven from their homes, and forced to
go to the hotels, and, as several of these hostelries
had been rendered uninhabitable, those that
escaped the flood were taxed to the limit of their
capacity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a good thing my other actors decided
not to come along,” remarked the manager, as he
and the boys, with Mr. Piper, found that all the
accommodations they could get were two small
rooms, fitted up with cots. “But we won’t be
here any longer than we can help. I’m going to
charter a boat, and start on the search for the
missing ones.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if this rain ever lets up we’ll get some
pictures,” declared Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the hotel were many whose homes had
either been washed away, or rendered uninhabitable,
and they were being cared for by the relief
committee, that had been hastily formed. Most
of these persons were poor, having their homes
in the lower section of the city, and many pathetic
stories were told. There had been some lives
lost, and a number had been injured by being
thrown into the water, and struck by floating
debris.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now the first thing to do,” said Mr. Ringold,
after the party had eaten a hasty meal, “is to
find out where our friends were last seen. Then
we can start on the hunt. And the next thing is
to get a boat. I’ll charter a big motor craft,
if I can find one, and we’ll live aboard her, taking
pictures, and conducting the search.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The missing company of moving picture actors
and actresses had been stopping at a hotel in
Hannibal. But this hotel had been abandoned,
and it was not until late that afternoon that a
former clerk could be located.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The moving picture players?” he repeated in
answer to questions from Mr. Ringold. “Oh,
yes, I remember them very well. We all liked
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what happened to them?” asked the
manager, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They all went out together, one day about a
week ago,” the clerk replied. “The river wasn’t
as high then as it is now, but it was bad enough.
They went off in a small motor boat, and said
they were going to one of the lower river islands,
to take some scenes. That is the last I heard of
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then they didn’t come back?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, the river rose suddenly that afternoon,
and we had our own troubles here. I heard nothing
more of the players.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then they might have been swept on down
stream?” suggested Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m very sorry to say that’s my opinion,”
spoke the clerk. “Still, they may have been
picked up, and saved. It’s hard to get any communications
through, as so many wires are down.
That’s all the information I can give you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanks; now we’ll start on the search,”
spoke Mr. Ringold. “Perhaps you can tell me
where I can hire a motor launch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This the clerk was able to do. A man had a
large craft he was willing to charter, though he
wanted a heavy price for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But boats are scarce,” he declared, “and
they’re badly needed in the rescue work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what we want this one for,” said Mr.
Ringold. “Now we’ll get her into commission.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>Clytie</i>, which was the name of the craft,
was roomy enough to accomodate the two boys,
Mr. Piper and the manager. Blake and Joe had
learned to run a gasoline launch, and Mr. Ringold
himself was an expert motorist, so there would
be no need of a helper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you want to look out for treacherous
currents,” the owner of the craft warned them.
“The river is worse than it’s been in years. And
remember, you’ve got to pay the bill if the boat
is damaged.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Putting the boat into commission was not so
quickly accomplished as Mr. Ringold had hoped.
There were many things to be done, and, at the
last moment some repairs had to be made.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rain stopped unexpectedly the day after
the arrival of our friends in Hannibal, and
Blake and Joe, hiring a rowboat, went out to get
some moving pictures. They secured some fine
views, but coming back they nearly had an accident.
For their boat was caught in a cross-current,
and would have been upset but for the
prompt work of Blake, who swung it around and
out of danger in time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I guess we’re ready, boys,” announced
the manager, two days after he had hired the
motor boat. “We’ll start out this morning.
We’ve got plenty of food, and other supplies, in
case we find the missing ones.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we’ve got plenty of films for pictures!”
cried Joe, as he and Blake took their places. The
rain still held off, and there were hopes that it
would clear long enough for the flood to subside.
But this was doubtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Mississippi was still a raging torrent, but
the <i>Clytie</i> was a stanch craft, and with care
would be able to navigate the turbulent stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All aboard!” cried Joe. And thus they
started on the trip.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />ANXIOUS HOURS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going to head for first?”
asked Blake, as he and Joe began “stowing
away” their belongings, while Mr. Ringold stood
at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For that island, where the hotel clerk said
our friends went to make pictures,” replied the
manager. “I know about where it is, as nearly
as he could tell me, and if they’re not on the one
they said they were going to, they may be on
another, for there are several together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you imagine they would be there all this
while?” asked Joe, as he got out one of the moving
picture cameras, for they were at a place now
where some thrilling views could be made.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is just possible they are,” answered Mr.
Ringold. “They may have landed, taken some
pictures, and then something may have happened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such as—what?” asked Mr. Piper. Of
late he had not made as many gloomy predictions
as usual. Perhaps he appreciated what Mr.
Ringold said, about there being enough trouble
without adding to it by needlessly looking on the
dark side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, their boat may have gone adrift in the
rising waters, and they may have been forced to
remain on the island,” went on the theatrical
man. “And there has been so much confusion
and suffering out here, that their appeals for
help, in case they could make any, may have gone
unheeded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I think we’ll head for that island, and
see if we can get any clews. It is a sort of forlorn
hope, but that is the only starting point I
can think of. How is she running, Blake?” he
asked, for Blake was attending to the motor,
while Joe focused the camera.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine,” answered the young engineer. “She’s
a powerful engine, all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’ll need to be,” was the grim comment of
the manager. “There is some power to this current,”
and he looked over the side of the bow, at
the onrushing, muddy Mississippi. Though they
were in the upper reaches of the big stream, it
had so increased in size that it was almost a constant
menace to the motor boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only was the current powerful, but there
were waves as large as those that might have been
encountered on some bay of the ocean; great, yellow
muddy waves, that curled after the <i>Clytie</i> as
though to overwhelm her. But the craft was in
skillful hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look at that!” cried Blake, as they swept
around a bend, and saw, in the flood, several
small houses being carried down together. “Get
that Joe!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m getting it!” shouted the young operator,
as he turned the lens of the camera in that direction,
and began grinding away at the handle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll put you over closer, so you can get a better
view,” called Mr. Ringold, as he headed the
bow of the motor boat in the direction of the
floating dwellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he did so there came a shout from shore,
and several men were see to put off in some small
boats. They pointed at the houses, and seemed
much excited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder what that means?” spoke C. C., as
he came from the enclosed cabin, out on the deck
where Joe had the camera. “I wonder if they
think they can haul those houses to shore?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It doesn’t seem possible—with only their
small boats,” remarked Blake. “They may be
able to anchor them, though, and save them when
the waters go down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d need an ocean tug to pull them out of
this current,” remarked Joe, as he continued to
take moving pictures. “But there must be
something up, or those men wouldn’t be so excited.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe they want us to try and tow the
houses,” suggested Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’re not going to do it,” decided the
manager. “It’s too risky, though I’d try it if
it was to save life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had hardly spoken, when the group of
houses swirled about in the current. At an upper
window of one of them appeared a woman, holding
in her arms a baby. She stretched the child
out toward those approaching her in small boats,
as if appealing for help.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, we’ve got to save her!” cried Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right!” agreed the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>He headed the motor boat more directly for
the floating dwellings, but he had to use caution,
as they were entangled in a mass of logs, jagged
timbers, and other debris, that made it difficult
to approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, by some strange freak of fate, the
houses swirled about again, and the woman and
child could no longer be seen. But the dwellings
remained upright, so it was fairly certain that
the two were safe in the upper room—at least
for a time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the current carried the houses on some
hidden sandbar, and they rose higher from the
water, tilted to one side, and remained there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out!” cried Mr. Piper, as the manager
continued to urge the motor boat onward. “We
may go aground ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t help it—we’ve got to try to save that
woman and baby!” cried Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there was no need for him to risk the
<i>Clytie</i>, for the small boats, that had put out from
shore came up then, and could more easily approach
the stranded dwellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll take ’em ashore, friends,” said one of
the men, in a small boat, to Mr. Ringold. “Just
as much obliged to you, though. Better keep out
from here, or you may stave a hole in your
craft.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what I was thinking,” the manager replied.
“We’ll stand by, though, and give you all
the help we can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then began the rescue of the woman and child
from the house on the sandbar. It was accomplished
with some difficulty, and the motor boat
was in a position where all the details could be
seen well. Joe had a good position for his
camera, and he ground away at the handle, getting a
series of fine views.</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman, sobbing hysterically, and clasping
the child in her arms, was lifted into one of the
boats, and wrapped in blankets, for it was beginning
to rain again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better let me tow you ashore—or near to
it,” proposed Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it would help some—it’s hard rowing,”
answered one of the rescuers. So the motor
craft was swung about until the three small boats,
which had come out to the houses, could be made
fast to her, and then she pulled them across the
swollen river to the shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boys did not hear the details of how the
woman came to be swept away in her house. It
was only one of many cases of people being
caught in the suddenly rising waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Approaching as near shore as was safe, on
account of the floating masses of debris, our
friends cast off the towing ropes, and proceeded
on their way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I got some fine pictures, anyhow,” declared
Joe, as he put away his camera, for it was
now raining so hard that no successful views
could be made.</p>

<p class='c008'>They kept on down the mighty Mississippi,
turning now and then to avoid obstructions, and
at times being obliged to swerve almost directly
across, which was not easy on account of the
powerful current.</p>

<p class='c008'>The river was constantly making new channels
for itself, and leaving old ones, but the Clytie was
a boat of small draught, and could easily navigate
in shallow places.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose we eat something?” proposed Blake,
for it was nearly noon. Considerable time had
passed at the rescue work.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a small gasoline stove in the cabin
of the boat, and they had with them plenty of
supplies, so it was not long before a meal was in
preparation. And, in spite of their anxiety about
the missing ones, our friends managed to eat
heartily. Even Mr. Piper seemed to lose most
of his gloom, as he passed his cup for more coffee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We ought to be near that island now,” observed
Mr. Ringold, as he looked across at the
shore nearest to which they then were. “The
hotel clerk said it was opposite a certain town,
with two white church steeples. There are the
two white church steeples he mentioned.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There isn’t much of the town left,” said
Blake. “It’s pretty well under water.” And
that was a fact. The lower part was submerged,
and as they came up to it, men could be
seen going about in boats, removing belongings
from houses, the lower floors of which were already
under water.</p>

<p class='c008'>No lives appeared to be in danger, for the people
had doubtless fled to higher ground on seeing
the rising waters. On the hills back of the town
could be noted a number of tents, where, very
likely, the refugees had taken up their abode.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t see anything of an island,” said
the manager, as he peered over the turbulent
stretch of muddy waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it was opposite this town, and the lower
part of the town is under water, the island is
probably covered up by now,” observed Blake,
grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid so,” agreed the manager. “We’ll
go over there, and make some inquiries.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By going toward shore they were not in such
a strong current, and soon the motor boat was
cruising along through what had been business
streets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is like being in Venice,” remarked Joe,
as the <i>Clytie</i> puffed slowly along between rows
of stores and houses, from which men, in boats,
were removing goods and furniture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looking for someone?” called a man, who
had, in a big scow, an odd collection of household
effects, and stuff from a general store.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For a company of moving picture players,”
answered Mr. Ringold. “They came down to
Pin Island, one day last week, to make some
drama scenes, and they haven’t come back. Can
you tell us where Pin Island is?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can tell you where it <i>was</i>,” said the man
grimly. “Right out there,” and he pointed to a
spot where nothing but a swirling rush of muddy
waters could be seen. “That’s where the island
<i>was</i>, and it’s probably there yet, but you can’t
see it,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you hear, or see, anything of the players?”
asked Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I did hear that some of them were
over there, just before the waters got so high,”
the man answered. “But what became of them
I don’t know. I’m very sorry, but I can’t help
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, this is some information, anyhow,”
spoke Mr. Ringold. “We know we are on the
right track.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d best look for ’em below here,” the
man in the scow went on. “They couldn’t
hardly make their way against the current.
You’ll probably find ’em below. There’s higher
ground there, and they’d have a better chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there another town near here?” asked
Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Bellmead, about four miles below.
They’ve got a good levee there, and aren’t so
badly off as we are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we’ll go to Bellmead,” decided Mr.
Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>The motor boat was turned out from the submerged
streets, and into the open river again.
It was still raining—quite hard now—and to try
for pictures was out of the question, as the sky
was dark and lowering.</p>

<p class='c008'>Keeping out of the middle of the Mississippi,
and along one edge, proceeding over what, when
the stream went down, would be ruined farming
fields, the motor boat went on her way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That must be Bellmead,” announced Joe, as
they made a turn into a “cut-off,” or place where
the river had made a new channel for itself. He
pointed to a place below them, as they could
see, more favorably situated than most along the
Mississippi. It was protected by a high levee,
or bank of earth and stone, and against this the
waters were beating.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll land here, and spend the night,” decided
Mr. Ringold. “No use going on in the
darkness, and we may get some news of our
friends here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But they were disappointed in this last. No
trace of the missing moving picture players could
be had.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, there’s a hotel where you can stay,”
said a man, one of several on the levee, “but
you may have to get out in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?” Blake wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because this levee is weakening, and if it
gives way the flood will be worse than ever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he spoke many more men came up on the
bank, evidently prepared for work. Back in the
town, also, could be seen long lines of negro
laborers, with wheelbarrows.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re going to pile all the dirt we can on
the levee,” said the man, who appeared to be in
charge. “It’s going to be an all-night job.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then let us help!” begged Mr. Ringold.
“We’ve got to tie up here over night, and our
safety, as well as yours, will depend on it. Let
us help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure!” cried Joe and Blake, and Mr. Piper
nodded his assent also.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we need all the help we can get,” spoke
the man on the bank. “Of course the colored
men will do the rough work, bringing up the
dirt in barrows, and bags, but they need to be
directed. You can help at that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then ensued anxious hours. The work
of strengthening the levee, to keep the river away
from the town, began at once, and was kept up
all night, by the light of flaring torches.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c006'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />OFF AGAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“More dirt over here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on now, boys! Lively’s the word!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hustle along!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is she rising any more?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Strike up a song, boys, and run; don’t
walk!”</p>

<p class='c008'>These were only a few of the remarks that
could be heard along the levee that night. The
rain drizzled down at intervals, as the colored
men, in long lines, with wheelbarrows, brought
up earth and stones, to strengthen the banks
against which the muddy Mississippi beat and
surged. The levee was like a dam along the
course of the stream, and back of this dam lay
the town. If the levee gave way the town might
be wiped out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now and then a group of the negro laborers
would break out into what was probably some
old plantation song, and to the rude but not
unmusical melody their feet moved in quicker
time, as they brought up the earth and stones for
filling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put more of it in bags,” directed Colonel
Whitmore, who, as the boys learned, was the
man to whom they had first spoken. “It will
hold better in bags, boys. Lively now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And while squads of men, up the hill where
the dirt was being dug, shoveled the earth into
bags, others wheeled them down and dumped, or
placed, them where directed by the white men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake, Joe, Mr. Ringold and C. C. Piper helped
in this work, and though they were only requested
to oversee the negroes, they did not hesitate
to use their own muscles when they were
needed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fact, Colonel Whitmore himself, and his
friends, worked harder than did any of the
black men, who were naturally slow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If she goes, boys, it’s all up with us, and
we’ll have to leave everything, and take to the
hills,” the colonel said. “So be lively, boys!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on now, everybody sing!” cried one
big negro, and he fairly ran with his heavy load,
his example being followed by others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, if we could only get some pictures of
this!” exclaimed Blake, during a lull in the levee
operations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s too dark,” decided Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can get some to-morrow morning,”
Colonel Whitmore told them. “We’ll still be
here in the morning, unless the river rises too
suddenly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it going up fast now?” asked Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“About an inch an hour, and that’s fast
enough for us,” was the grim answer, and the
Southerner looked at a stick he had thrust into
the bank at the edge of the stream, to keep watch
of the rate of rise. It was marked with little
notches, an inch apart, and these notches were
slowly, but gradually and relentlessly, being covered
by the rising flood of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c008'>All through the night they toiled, the moving
picture boys working with feverish energy to do
what they could to help save the town. There
was really no obligation on them to do this, but
they felt a friendly interest in those whose homes
were in danger from the great flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the boys, also, might be said to have a
little selfish motive. They wanted to get moving
pictures of the work of strengthening the levee,
as this would form part of the series of stirring
views they hoped to get. Thus another of the
many phases of the work of fighting the flood
could be shown.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barrow-load after barrow-load of dirt was
piled on the levee, and bags of earth and stone
placed where they would do the most good.
Everyone was working hard, by the light of the
flaring torches. It was hard, dirty and unpleasant
labor, for it rained at intervals, all night.
Splashing through the mud, slipping and sliding
on the treacherous footing, Joe and Blake toiled
with the rest. They wore their rubber boots
and raincoats, which, in a great measure, protected
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, be it said to the credit of Christopher
Cutler Piper, he labored as hard as any of the
others, and never made a complaint.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s coming morning,” said Colonel Whitmore,
as he pointed to a faint gray streak in the
east. “We’ll have better light to work by, soon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Slowly the light grew, and, with the coming
of the dawn, the rain ceased—at least for a
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’ll give us time to catch our breaths,”
spoke the Southerner, with a sigh of relief. “But
she hasn’t stopped rising,” he added, as he looked
at the stick-gauge. “Too much water up above,”
and he nodded in the direction whence the boys
had come, down the stream. “It’ll be days before
she goes down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as it was light enough, Blake and Joe
got out a moving picture camera, and began
taking views of the work at the levee. More
laborers had come with the advent of daylight,
and other white men arrived to relieve those
who had overseen the work during the hours
of darkness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scene on the levee was a lively one, and
also a dangerous one, for the waters were beating
with ever-increasing force on the sloping
wall of earth and stones, that held back the
raging torrent from the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This will be one great picture,” murmured
Joe, as he contemplated the series of scenes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is, if you get a chance to develop it,
and show it,” remarked Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it looks to me as if this flood was
going to get worse, and if we go down stream,
where the river is wider, we may not be able
to pull through.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold on there!” cried Mr. Ringold, shaking
a warning finger at the actor. “Don’t let your
liver get away with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so—I forgot,” exclaimed C. C. “I
guess we’ll pull through all right, after all,” he
added in more cheerful tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the way to talk!” cried Blake, encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>That was one peculiar trait of Mr. Piper’s.
He could be gloomy when there was no particular
danger, save what he imagined was in prospect.
And then, when a crisis came, he rose to
the emergency, and was a real help.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun tried to break through the clouds, as
Joe and Blake finished their pictures, for they
did not want to give too much film space showing
the mere work of strengthening the levee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want to save some in case—well, not to
make a gloomy prediction—but in case the levee
breaks,” said Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And it looks to me as though it would go—if
this rain keeps up and the river continues to
rise,” said Mr. Ringold. “I don’t know that we
can do much else here, so I think we might as
well start off again, and continue our search.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had taken rooms at the hotel the evening
before, but they had had very little use of them,
since they had spent the night on the levee.
Their motor boat had been tied up at a dock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, let’s go up to the hotel, wash, have
breakfast, and then continue our voyage,” suggested
Blake. “Might as well do that as to try
to cook aboard. We’ll have more room at the
Mansion House.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His companions agreed with him, and they
were soon enjoying the luxury of a bath and a
good meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had scarcely finished, however, before a
messenger came up from the river on the run.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s the folks that own that there motor,
boat?” he demanded, “the folks that helped
Colonel Whitmore last night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here we are!” called Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the trouble?” Joe wanted to know,
for the messenger appeared excited.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’d better get your craft out of the way,”
went on the man. “The river’s started to rise
suddenly, and she may be damaged where she
is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll get right down to her,” exclaimed Mr.
Ringold, and, paying their bill, they hastened to
the dock. They found the <i>Clytie</i> pulling and
straining at her mooring ropes, for the river had
indeed risen and the cables were taut, caused by
the elevation of the boat at the dock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All aboard!” called Mr. Ringold, and soon
they were under way again. There was no need
of their assistance at the levee, for all possible
was being done by the town inhabitants, and
those on the elevated bank of dirt and stones
waved a farewell to our friends, as they went
on down the raging river.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />UPSIDE DOWN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Say, there’s a lot more stuff coming down
the river than has at any time yet,” remarked
Blake, as he and his friends sat in the cabin of
the <i>Clytie</i>, while she made her way in the flooded
stream. “Look at those big logs, and parts of
houses!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and we’ve got to be careful,” said Mr.
Ringold, who had relinquished the wheel to Joe.
“First thing we know we may bump into a log,
and have a hole stove into us. Then we will
have trouble!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I guess——” began C. C., when there
came a bump on the port bow of the craft.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” cried the manager, leaping
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only a little log,” answered Joe. “I didn’t
see it until I was right on top of it, or I could
have steered out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was going to say I guessed nothing would
happen,” went on C. C., “but I reckon I was a
bit mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it’s nothing worse than that we won’t
kick,” murmured Blake. “Still you never can
tell. I’ll come up there, Joe, and help you keep
a lookout for big bits of wreckage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would be a good idea to have two at the
wheel,” said Mr. Ringold. “We’ll do that after
this, and we won’t try to do any night travel—we’ll
just tie up at dark, wherever we can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There must be a worse flood up above, than
there was at first, to bring all this stuff down,”
observed Joe, when he and Blake were on duty.
“Whole villages must have been swept away, to
judge by the pieces of houses I’ve seen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and farm-places, too,” added Blake, as
he pointed to a part of a wrecked barn swirling
around in the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later they passed a village, partly submerged,
and as they swung in close to it Mr.
Ringold shouted questions as to the possible
whereabouts of his lost players. No one, however,
knew anything about them. They seemed
to have disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever Blake and Joe saw interesting sights
they used the moving picture cameras to advantage.
But much of the desolate scenery along
the flooded river was of the same character, and
they wanted to save their films for more dramatic
situations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the river was higher, the rain, which
had ceased that morning, did not commence
again, and the skies seemed much brighter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know much about the weather conditions
out here,” said Mr. Ringold, “but it looks
to me as though it were going to clear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope so,” murmured Mr. Piper. “It feels
as if I’d never get dried out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was indeed damp, muggy and sticky. The
moving picture boys, too, found difficulty in getting
satisfactory results under such weather conditions,
but they did the best they could.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you doing?” asked Joe of Blake,
on the afternoon of the day they had left the
levee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Making some waterproof covers for the exposed
film,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To keep it dry from the rain?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, to keep it dry in case we—well, in case
anything happens, as Mr. Piper would say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean?” Joe wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean we may have an accident at any
time. While this motor boat is a good one, she
may be wrecked, especially when we get down
to the lower river, where the flood is sure to be
worse. There’ll be more debris there, and we
may easily be stove in, crushed or upset.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, you’re worse than he is, lately,” cried
Joe, with a nod at Mr. Piper, who was out on
the stern deck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I only want to take all precautions,”
Blake went on. “We’ve got some valuable films
here, and if they fall into the water they’ll be
spoiled. It was bad enough for Munson, or
whoever it was, to take our other films, and I
don’t want to lose these in the flood. So I’m
going to stow them away in water-tight boxes,
as fast as we expose them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In anticipation of water troubles the boys had
brought along some sheets of rubberized cloth,
and this was now used to line, and wrap about
and seal up, small boxes, in which the exposed
films could be packed. Thus it was hoped to
save them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dinner had been eaten aboard the boat, and
then, as they proceeded, they stopped at several
places along the flooded Mississippi, to make inquiries
for the missing ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>But so many persons had either been carried
away by the great flood, or driven from their
homes, and so many unfortunate occurrences
filled the minds of the people, that no one could
remember, or tell about, any missing moving
picture players.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, too, at several of the towns, the levees
were in danger, and all available help was engaged
in making them stronger. It was a time
of stress and trouble for all.</p>

<p class='c008'>After leaving one small city, that was threatened
by the rising river, our friends proceeded
well out in the stream, as they had been informed
a dangerous “cut-off” had formed just
below, and they might be drawn into it, and
stranded in a big swamp.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll avoid that, if we can,” said Mr. Ringold,
as they came within sight of the “cut-off,”
and saw where the stream had divided.</p>

<p class='c008'>The manager was at the wheel, and, as he put
it hard over, so as to give the dangerous current
an extra wide berth, the motor unexpectedly
stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?” cried Mr. Ringold, as
he noticed, with alarm, that they were being
drawn into the “cut-off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Motor’s gone dead!” cried Blake, as he
sprang toward it. “I will see if I can start it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But though he turned and turned again the
flywheel, the machine would not go. It was
rather an old-fashioned one, and worked hard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got plenty of gasoline?” asked Joe, coming
up to the help of his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There was half an hour ago, and we can’t
have used up all in the tank yet. Besides, we’ve
got a barrel in reserve.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll put some in, anyhow!” cried Joe. But,
when this was done, the motor still refused to
go, and they were being carried by the current
nearer and nearer to the dangerous place.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me try,” suggested Mr. Ringold.
“Here, you boys steer, though you can’t really
do much without power to give us more headway
than we’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again and again he spun the wheel, but it
seemed of no use. The motor remained dead.
Then, as Mr. Piper came up to see if he could
lend any aid, he saw a small dangling wire, that
no one appeared to have noticed, or attended to.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that the trouble?” he asked. “That loose
wire?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s it—the ignition!” cried Mr. Ringold.
“I’ll have it fixed in a jiffy now. Though I
don’t know as we can make it,” he added, as he
noticed how near they were to the treacherous
“cut-off.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But he was not one to give up easily, nor
were his companions. The broken wire was hastily
joined, and then, with the electric current in
proper shape, when the flywheel was spun again,
the motor responded with a welcome roar and
throb.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now see if we can make it!” cried Mr.
Ringold, as he took the wheel. “It’s a bare
chance!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was, and how slender the boys did not
realize until later. The powerful current pulled
and tugged at them, to force them off the
course, and into a branch of the stream that
ended in a dismal swamp.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the <i>Clytie</i> was a stanch craft, and was in
good hands. Slowly but surely she fought her
way against the cross-current, pulling away from
danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m giving her all the gas she can take,”
murmured Mr. Ringold, as he advanced the
throttle to its limit, and set the spark timer at
its most advantageous position. “She can’t do
any more!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake and Joe stood ready to do all possible,
but it was not much. They had to depend on
the motor. And that machine made good. The
propeller, beating the muddy water to foam,
slowly shoved the craft ahead, and to one side,
until, finally, the pull of the cross-current was
lessened. Then, gathering speed, the boat made
her way into the main channel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Safe—for a while at least!” cried Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>The danger to which they had been exposed
rather unnerved them for the time being. All
that afternoon they kept on down the great river,
the boys taking occasional pictures. The rain
still held off, for which they were very thankful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now we’d better look for a good place
at which to tie up for the night,” remarked Mr.
Ringold, when preparations for supper were
under way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That looks like a good place, just around
that bend,” spoke Blake, pointing to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll make for it,” decided the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they went along they found that the bend
was caused by a “cut-off” having made a new
channel for itself, to the left of the main stream.
This “cut-off” was larger and deeper than any
they had yet encountered. It was bringing down
a mass of debris, too, and some care had to
be used in navigating near it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will do for a place to spend the night,”
decided Mr. Ringold, as he shifted his course
slightly. They were behind a wooded point, and,
as they rounded it, the two boys uttered cries
of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>For, coming straight toward them, was a small
house, turned completely upside down in the
water.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />CHARLIE HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Look at that!” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so!” echoed his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Must have been a queer freak of the flood
that could do that,” commented Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me for a picture!” exclaimed Joe, as he
got out the camera.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there light enough?” questioned Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess so—for a short run of film,” answered
his chum, and then, as the house, in its
queer position, drifted down stream, and as the
motor boat approached it, the occupants seeking
a safe place to tie up for the night, Joe got a
series of moving pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There it goes—stranded!” cried Blake,
when his friend had finished grinding away at
the crank of the camera. And, as he spoke, the
house came to a sudden stop.</p>

<p class='c008'>Probably the roof which was submerged in
the water, had struck against a sandbar, or some
high place in the land that was under water.</p>

<p class='c008'>At any rate, the upside-down dwelling turned
slowly about, settled a little to one side, and
then remained stationary in the water. It had
stranded in a small cove, in which the moving
picture boys, and their two friends, had also
decided to take shelter for the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll tie up to that big tree over there,” said
Mr. Ringold, pointing to a large oak that overhung
the water. “I think that will stand, even
though the waters rise higher.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tie with a long rope,” advised Mr. Piper.
“The river may rise suddenly in the night, and
if we are held fast by a short cable, and can’t
rise with the ‘tide,’ we’ll sink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll look out for that,” promised the manager.
“But I think the river is not rising so
fast now. We can tell when we get near
shore.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It looks like more rain,” remarked Joe, with
a glance at the sky. “You wouldn’t think there
could be so much water; would you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hardly,” agreed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>The work of making the boat fast was soon
finished. Certainly the oak tree to which they
tied seemed, with its great trunk, and spread of
roots, strong enough to withstand many a flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now for supper!” cried Joe, it being
his turn to prepare the evening meal. The gasoline
stove was started, and soon the appetizing
odor of ham and eggs floated over the flood waters,
for our friends had purchased a supply
at the last village where they had stopped to
make inquiries.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only hope Birdie Lee, and the rest of ’em,
are having as good a meal as this,” murmured
Blake, as he passed his plate for a second helping.
“I’d give a good deal to know where they
are now, and be able to help them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think we all would,” came from Mr. Ringold,
and he spoke rather solemnly. “It’s
strange we can’t get any word of them,” he
went on. “At the next town we make, if they
have any telegraph service, I am going to wire
my New York office, and ask if any word has
been received there. Levinberg probably knows
I’d be anxious about them, after hearing of the
flood, and he might think to wire me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pretty bad telegraph service, all along the
river now, I guess,” commented Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But they may be able to get a message
through, somehow,” said the manager, hopefully.
“We’ll wait half a day or so, after I
send the dispatch, in case an answer should come
back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Supper over, the bunks were arranged for the
night. The weather was calmer now than at any
time since the storms began that had caused the
flood. The sun shone through the clouds a little,
as it set. Blake and Joe, on the after deck of
the motor boat, looked about them. On all
sides stretched a vast extent of waters. They
had driven a stake in near shore, and watched
it to note the rise of the river. It was very
slight now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!” exclaimed Blake, as he glanced over
toward the upside-down house, “let’s go over
there and look inside. Maybe we can find something
of value, that we might save for the
owners.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m with you,” agreed Joe. Mr. Ringold
offered no objection, and, after casting off the
line, the motor boat was started up, proceeding
slowly to the side of the overturned dwelling.
The craft was then made fast to a hook in one
corner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go in,” proposed Blake, when they had
gazed through a window for a moment, not
being able, however, to distinguish much.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you act in an upside-down house?”
asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have to walk on the ceiling, of course,”
answered his chum. “The ceiling is the floor
and the floor the ceiling. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They crawled in through a window. As Blake
had said, they had to step on the ceiling, and with
caution, too, for it was only lath and plaster.
Over their heads was the floor, with the sagging
carpet still tacked to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course all the furniture was on the ceiling,
too, and it was in great confusion. Bureaus
had fallen on their sides, smashing the plaster,
and pictures had dropped from their hooks and
lay on the ceiling. The house was a flat-roofed
one, and all of what had been the third story
was now under water. The third story was
now the cellar, and the cellar, or what had
corresponded to it, was the attic. Though, as
the bottom of the cellar had been left on the
ground when the house was washed from the
foundations, there was no roof to the “attic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite a mix-up!” murmured Joe, as they
went from room to room, stepping over the tops
of the door openings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beds and furniture were piled in confusion
in the different rooms, much of the stuff being
broken. There were evidences, too, that water
had come in some of the rooms, probably when
the house turned over, but it had drained out,
and now the rooms on the middle or second
story were comparatively dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go upstairs, or, rather, downstairs, to
the first story,” suggested Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once on the top, or, rather, bottom floor, the
boys found more confusion. The dining room
table had fallen with its legs in the air, and piled
about it was a buffet and chairs. The dishes
lay about, broken and cracked.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the kitchen the weight of the stove, falling
from the floor to the ceiling, had caused it to
crash through the lath and plaster, in which it
was imbedded, partly covered by the cooking
utensils.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing much of value here,” commented
Blake, as they walked about on the ceilings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s go back up; or, rather, downstairs,”
suggested Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Find anything?” asked the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing worth saving for the owners,”
Blake answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, we’d better be getting back,”
suggested Mr. Piper. “It will soon be dark,
and there’s no telling when this house may go
adrift, or turn right-side up again. I don’t want
to be in it when it does.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were about to crawl out of the window
again, to get into their boat, when a curious cry
stopped them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hark!” exclaimed Blake. “What was
that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It sounded like someone crying,” said Mr.
Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mamma!	Mamma!” came the plaintive
call from one of the bedrooms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is someone crying!” decided the manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And in here, too,” added Blake, as he made
a turn in the direction of the sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again it came—a pitiful cry:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mamma! I want you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are you? Who are you?” asked Mr.
Ringold, as he and the others followed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>And there, sitting up amid a pile of bedclothes
in a corner, hitherto unobserved, was a small
boy, about eight years old. He had evidently
just awakened, and was starting to cry. He
rubbed his sleepy eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my little man, who are you?” asked
the manager, kindly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m Charlie,” was the answer, “and I want
my mamma.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Charlie; eh?” went on the manager. “Well,
tell us your other name, and maybe we can find
your mamma for you. What’s your last name?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ain’t got none. I’m just Charlie, and I
want my mamma!” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just Charlie,” went on Mr. Ringold. “Well,
I guess we’ll have to take you along with us,
and we’ll try to find your mamma. Will you
come with us, Charlie—er—well, ‘just’ Charlie?”
and he smiled at the little chap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call him Charlie House,” suggested Joe,
with a smile. “We found him in a house, so
call him Charlie House.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good idea! We will!” decided the manager.
“Will you come with us, Charlie House?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I’ll come with you,” answered the boy,
as he threw off the bedclothes. “But my name
is just Charlie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Just Charlie, or Charlie House, come
along then. I expect you’re hungry, and we’ll
feed you, and do all we can for you,” the manager
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the confidence of childhood, that knows
no fear, the boy walked over the ceiling toward
the rescuers. His clothing was in disorder, and
his face was grimy from crying. Evidently, after
the accident, he had cried himself to sleep. How
he came to be alone in the overturned house
could be but guessed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” suddenly cried Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole house seemed to shake and tremble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s adrift again, and going to turn over!”
yelled Joe. “Come on! Let’s get out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was evident that the dwelling was going to
be righted by the flood, for it tilted more and
more.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />LOOKING FOR MOTHER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Look out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make for the boat!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Grab up the boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lively, or it will be too late!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus exclaiming, the rescuers made their hurried
way toward the window, near which the
boat was tied. Mr. Ringold had caught up
Charlie House, as they had elected to call him,
and, with the child in his arms, was given the
right of way—that is, the others stood aside, and
let the manager get to the window first.</p>

<p class='c008'>Luckily the turning of the house was slow, and
by a chance swirl of the current, the motor boat
had been swung broadside to the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>Also the tilting of the house was in the direction
of that side where was the window by
which they had entered, so that the upper part,
corresponding to the sill, was nearer to the water,
so they could more easily get over it, and into
the <i>Clytie</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an instant Mr. Ringold had leaped into the
boat and moved back out of the way, to make
space for the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go ahead, boys!” cried Mr. Piper, as he
stood to one side in the house, near the window,
and waited for Blake and Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you go!” insisted Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on—don’t argue! She’s going to turn
over again!” cried Mr. Ringold, and then the
gloomy comedian fairly thrust, first Joe, and
then Blake, through the window, from which
the sash had been broken. The moving picture
actor followed an instant later, and not a second
too soon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cut the rope!” yelled the manager, who
was holding Charlie. The boy was crying again,
probably from fright.</p>

<p class='c008'>With one stroke of his keen-bladed knife,
Blake severed the cable, and the boat drifted
away from the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, no sooner was the craft free than, amid
a great swirl of the waters, the dwelling turned
right-side up again, the furniture and kitchen
utensils inside falling from ceiling to floor with
a crash.</p>

<p class='c008'>So big was the wave caused by this righting
of the house that the <i>Clytie</i> was nearly swamped.
She bobbed about on the swell, and went nearly
over. But she was a well balanced craft, and,
after a bit, rode on an even keel once more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Narrow escape, that,” said Mr. Ringold, solemnly,
as he tried to comfort Charlie. The little
lad was sobbing:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wants my mamma, I does! I wants my
mamma! I want to go home!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll take you home, and to your mamma,
as soon as we can,” promised the manager,
soothingly. “But don’t you want to sleep in
this nice boat, to-night? And see, I’ll make the
choo-choo engine go for you. Won’t that be
nice?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answered Charlie, now, smiling
through his tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>The motor was set going, and, as the house
drifted on down stream, upright once more, and
freed from the sandbar on which it had stranded,
the motor boat was steered toward the big
oak tree, where she was to be tied for the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charlie House was so interested now, in the
working of the machinery, and the various novel
sights aboard the motor craft, that he forgot his
loneliness. Blake spread him some bread and
jam, and this completed the temporary happiness
of the poor little waif.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later he was given more supper, which he
ate with a fine appetite, showing that he must
have been without food for some time. There
was a spare bunk on the <i>Clytie</i>, and Charlie, the
traces of his tears washed away, was soon sleeping
comfortably in this.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are we going to do?” asked Blake,
when the others sat in the small cabin that night,
talking over the situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ve got to try to locate his mother,
of course,” said Mr. Ringold. “I’ll have a talk
with him in the morning, and see if I can’t find
out from what town or city it was his house was
carried away. He ought to know where he
lived, even if he doesn’t recall his own name.
And that may come to him by daylight. We’ll
just let him sleep now, and get some ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us,”
commented C. C. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Going to stand watch and watch to-night?”
asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t see any need of it,” answered Mr.
Ringold. “We are out of the way of the main
flood here, and, even if the river does rise, we’ll
be all right. I think we’ll all go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The night was a rather restless one for all
save Charlie House. The little chap slept
through it all, though about midnight the river
began to rise again, as those aboard the boat
could tell by her motions. But they were
moored with a long cable, and it would need a
great lift to put them in danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did my mamma come?” asked Charlie, as
soon as he opened his eyes in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but she’ll be here soon, I hope,” said
Blake, who was near the bunk of the small chap.
Charlie’s eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, and see me get breakfast,” urged
Joe, who was willing to do his share in providing
amusement for the little fellow. “I’ll show you
how to make flap-jacks,” he went on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s flap-jacks?” asked Charlie, interested
at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, maybe your mamma calls them
griddle-cakes—or pancakes,” said Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I love pancakes!” Charlie exclaimed,
and the danger of a crying spell was over, for
the time being, at least.</p>

<p class='c008'>With prepared flour, Joe mixed up a batter,
and soon the cakes were browning on a greased
griddle, on the gasoline stove. There was maple
syrup to eat on them, and with hot coffee for
the older ones, there was served a meal anyone
might have enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re having it too easy,” complained Blake,
as he took a third helping of cakes. “It seems
as though, in a flood like this, we ought to be
eating hard tack.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we may come to that yet,” said Joe,
with a sigh. And it was not long after that when
they recalled this talk, at a time when indeed they
would have given much for even some hard tack.</p>

<p class='c008'>But matters were propitious enough now, and,
after the morning meal, the boat was started off
again on her now double quest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think the best plan for us to follow,” said
Mr. Ringold, when they were heading into the
main river, “will be to stop at the first town
we come to, and make inquiries, both about our
friends, and Charlie’s mother. I’ll question him
and see if he knows where he used to live.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Charlie’s memory was either very faulty,
or the events of the flood had driven all recollection
from his mind. All he could say was
that he lived “home” with his papa and mamma,
and he wanted them both, though, for the time,
he was willing to stay with his new friends, and
watch the “choo-choo” engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what did your father do?” asked Blake,
thinking they might get some clew, if they knew
his occupation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He works,” said Charlie, contentedly. “He
works for mamma and me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you don’t know where you lived?” inquired
C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I lived home,” was all Charlie would say.
“Then it rained, and mamma and papa took a
lot of things out of our house, over to grandma’s
house. Grandma lives on a hill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They must have moved their valuables out
when they saw the flood rising,” commented Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened after that?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It rained,” said Charlie, simply. “Mamma
and papa took more things over to grandma’s,
and I went to sleep. When I woke up it was
all dark, and my bed was crooked. I guess I
fell out of my bed,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was when the house went upside-down,
I guess he means,” suggested Mr. Ringold. “I
can imagine what happened,” he went on, in a
low tone, as the boy went to the after rail to
watch the debris floating by. “His folks began
carrying out their valuables, and left him in the
house. They made one trip too many, and the
house was carried away, and upset. Charlie was
in it, and he stayed in it until we rescued him.
Now we’ve just got to trust to luck to find his
folks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were fairly out on the flooded Mississippi
again, and from the manner in which they
were tossed about, and swirled this way and that,
it could easily be guessed that the river had been
augmented during the night, and that more rain
had fallen along the upper water-shed.</p>

<p class='c008'>They stopped, about noon, at a small village,
partly under water, and, while Joe and Blake
made some pictures, Mr. Ringold and C. C.
inquired for any word of the missing players,
and for news of Charlie’s folks. To send off
any telegrams proved out of the question.</p>

<p class='c008'>So many families had been separated, and so
many mothers were looking for lost children, as
well as children inquiring for missing parents,
that no progress was made.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, Charlie House seemed contented
enough now, with his new friends. He was
much better off than in the upside-down house,
for he was comfortable and had enough to eat.
He had been rescued only just in time, too, for
he probably would have been killed, or at least
severely injured, when the dwelling righted itself
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>The work of saving their belongings was being
undertaken by many of the people of the village
where our friends stopped, and scenes of this
were filmed by the moving picture boys. Work
was also in progress on a hastily-constructed
levee, in an endeavor to prevent the whole of
the town from being washed away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more the rescue party was off. There
was more danger now, as there was still more
debris coming down the big, muddy water, and
several times the boat was nearly struck by a
floating house, or barn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to keep a sharp lookout!” decided
Mr. Ringold. “It won’t do to be swamped—there’d
be no getting ashore in this flood. Keep
your eyes open, boys!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With one in the stern and another at the
bow, taking turns, the rescuers did all they could
to prevent the boat from being damaged, by
fending off logs and heavy driftwood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day wore on, and though they stopped at
several other towns, in a search for Charlie’s
mother, their quest was unsuccessful. Nor was
anything heard of the missing players.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I guess we’ll have to look for another
stopping place for the night,” remarked Mr.
Ringold, late that afternoon. He was about to
turn the wheel over to Joe, for a rest, when
Blake, who was in the extreme bow, cried out:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quick! Put her over! We’re going to ram
a barn!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />FIRE AND FLOOD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For a moment Joe and Mr. Ringold did not
know whether or not Blake was joking. But
the lad in the bow cried again:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Steer to the right, or you’ll be into the barn,
sure! It’s directly in our course!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Blake, springing back out of the
front of the boat, gave his chum and the manager
a clear view ahead, for he had been rather
obstructing their vision. The two at the wheel
saw a small barn, swirling around in the water.
It was upright, and was directly in their path.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a quick spin of the wheel Joe turned the
rudder, and the <i>Clytie</i> glided past the barn, her
rub-streak fairly grazing the structure. The
barn had been hidden from view by a large tree
which had drifted down with it, and the sudden
separation of the foliage and the farm structure,
revealed the latter to Blake just in time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, as the motor boat swept on, there came
from the interior of the barn a loud:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Moo!”</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same moment a cow stuck her head out
of a small window, and looked piteously at the
rescuers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too bad! We can’t do anything for you,
old cow!” cried Blake. “I guess you’re done
for, unless your barn floats to shore. I wish we
had room for you,” he went on, whimsically, “for
we could use fresh milk very nicely.” They had
been obliged to put up with the condensed variety
thus far.</p>

<p class='c008'>The barn swept on down stream, turning
around and around, as the boat went past it, the
cow’s head appearing at each turn, thrust
through the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a small moving picture camera, Blake
got a few views of this odd scene, to add to the
others already taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>They decided to tie up for the night just above
a small town, that was far enough from the banks
of the Mississippi to have escaped the flood, thus
far. But the inhabitants were in constant fear,
and all available men were at work strengthening
the levee.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our friends managed to purchase a few supplies,
and they got some fresh milk, which luxury
Charlie had missed very much, for he was
accustomed to drinking it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little boy was quite fretful after supper,
and cried for his lost home and parents. But
Blake induced him to listen to some fairy stories,
and finally Charlie House fell asleep, and was
put in his bunk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor little chap,” murmured Blake, as he
tucked the child in snugly. “Poor little chap!”
And then Blake thought of Birdie Lee, and the
others of the lost theatrical party.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you boys will stay here with the boat,
Mr. Piper and I will go to town and see if there
is any answer to the telegram I sent this morning,
from the upper village,” said Mr. Ringold,
when dusk had fallen. He had taken this
method, instead of waiting for an answer to
his wire. A message had been sent to the New
York office, asking if any news had been received
of the missing ones, and a request was
made that any reply might be sent to Canton,
which was the village above which they were
now tied up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure, we’ll stay here,” agreed Joe. “And I
hope you get some word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was a vain hope, there being no reply
to the message of inquiry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The river is slowly rising,” remarked Mr.
Piper, with something of a return of his former
gloomy manner. “It’s going up about an inch
and a half an hour. The townspeople are afraid
it will break the levee, which is only a temporary
one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t want to live out in this country,”
commented Blake. “This flood is likely to occur
every year.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I guess they’re used to it, somewhat,”
spoke Mr. Ringold. “But this is the worst they
ever had. I’m really alarmed for our friends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve been alarmed all along,” went on C. C.
“That is, of course there may be a chance for
them,” he said, quickly, for he had made up his
mind, at least while on this voyage, to try to
look on the bright side of things.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sincerely hope there will be a chance,” murmured
Mr. Ringold. “I would feel very badly,
indeed, if I thought they were lost while making
pictures for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For some time that evening the rescuers sat
about in the small cabin, talking over the situation.
For some reason, though no one could
account for it, there was a feeling of gloom in
the hearts of all. Perhaps the fact that no word
had come from New York induced it. But, certain
it is, that no one felt very cheerful.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were moored near shore, and just above
where the temporary levee, to protect the village,
began. Below, above, and in front of them,
swirled the dreary waste of waters. The Mississippi
had spread itself out to more than twice
its usual width, and had inundated much valuable
land. It had washed away many houses and
farm buildings, and many towns and cities were
partly under the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>And there was no certainty that the storm was
over. True, the skies brightened now and then,
but, as night fell, the heavens were overcast once
more, and the wind, shifting, seemed to promise
more downpours.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess I’ll put double water-proof wrappings
on the films, to-night,” said Joe, just before
he prepared for bed. “I certainly wouldn’t
want anything to happen to them now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake aided him in the work, and the boxes
of exposed films were made as secure as possible
against dampness and water.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the middle of the night Blake awoke. He
heard a curious roaring, throbbing noise on the
deck over his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” he asked, speaking aloud, involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More rain,” answered Joe, in a low voice.
He, too, had been awakened.</p>

<p class='c008'>The storm had started again, and the drops
were pelting down on the afflicted land.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This will make the river still higher,” went
on Blake. “I wish we were out of this—and
had the missing ones, and Charlie’s folks, safe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So do I,” answered Joe. “My! but I’m sick
of the sound of rain!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The little boy, in the bunk near Blake, awakened,
either from hearing the talk, or from the
noise of the storm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m hungry! I want my mamma!” he
called.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll get you something to eat,” said Blake,
kindly, “and maybe mamma will come in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up, and made some cracker and jam
sandwiches for Charlie, who munched them contentedly,
and went to sleep again.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake then opened the cabin door, and looked
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How is it?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pretty fierce!” murmured Blake, as he crept
back to his bunk. “Pretty fierce. It’s a raging
torrent out there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Morning brought no cessation of the rain,
though it was not coming down quite so hard
after the dreary dawn broke. As our friends sat
down to breakfast, they could see the alarmed
villagers working frantically at the levee. For
the rising waters were already lapping the top
of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long lines of men, carrying bags and baskets
of dirt and stones, piled them along the bank—the
frail bank that alone stood between the flood
and their homes! The boys took some pictures
of the work, and then, casting off the mooring
line, the trip down the river was resumed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although it rained, Blake and Joe were not
idle. They knew that many pictures were needed,
and they set to work to get them, though
they would not be as good as those made in clear
weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>After dinner, rounding a bend in the stream,
they came in sight of a town the greater part of
which was under water, and, as they steered
toward it, Mr. Ringold having said they would
make a stop, Joe cried out:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look! There’s a house on fire!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So there is!” shouted Blake. “Fire and
flood together! It couldn’t be much worse!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Those on the boat looked with awe, and feelings
of deep sorrow, on the unhappy scene. The
fire seemed gaining headway, in spite of the rain,
and, as they approached, a second house caught
from the first, the black smoke rolling skyward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Put over there!” cried Mr. Ringold to C. C.,
who was steering. “Maybe we can help them—or
rescue someone! Put over!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />A HAPPY MEETING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Fanned by a strong wind, the flames gained
headway rapidly, and soon both houses were
wrapped in fire, while over them hung a black
pall of smoke. The dwellings were close together,
and it seemed likely that more would
catch, as there was no possibility of using the
fire engines, if so small a town possessed them.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the streets of the village were three feet
or more under water, and the curious sight was
presented of houses surrounded by a flood being
destroyed by fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The stoves must have upset, or something
like that, to cause the fire!” cried Blake, as the
motor boat was steered toward the blazing dwellings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re beginning the work of rescue now,”
called Mr. Ringold. “See, they’re coming in
boats.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A number of small craft, containing several
men, who had evidently been engaged in either
rescue or salvage work, in another part of the
town, came rowing along the inundated streets
toward the scene of the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look!” shouted C. C. “Someone just
jumped from one of the windows then! And
there goes another!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They all looked in time to see a body plunge
downward into the water, and one of the boats
swerved toward it. Those aboard the <i>Clytie</i> saw,
a moment later, a woman pulled from the flood,
and taken into the small boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same moment another body shot from
a window of the first burning house, and this
person, too, was rescued.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After all, the water is a good thing,” remarked
Blake, as he hastily oiled the motor.
“They couldn’t jump on the hard ground, but
the flood saves them, even if it does destroy their
houses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are certainly having their own
troubles,” observed Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll help them all we can!” cried the manager.
“Get out some of the life preservers,
boys, and the cork rings. It may be that we
shall need them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had provided themselves with these appliances
before starting off on their trip, and
Blake and Joe now took them from the lockers
and laid them where they could be gotten at
instantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw a fire once,” remarked little Charlie,
who was an interested observer of the fearsome
scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you?” asked C. C., who had taken a
great liking to the small chap. “Where?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our barn burned up,” the child went on,
“but pa, he got our horse out, and the cow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He must have lived on a farm,” said the
actor to the boys, “and yet that upside-down
house we took him from didn’t look like a farm
dwelling. It was more like a city place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He may have lived on a farm when he was
younger,” observed Blake. “I wonder if we’ll
ever find his folks?”</p>

<p class='c008'>No one answered him, for they were all intent
on watching the fire. Five houses were
now ablaze, and people were jumping from all
of them, so that the men in the boats had all
they could do to make the rescues. Farther
along the row of dwellings, persons were preparing
to leave, for it was evident that nothing
could save their homes except a change of wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>But boats were needed to enable them to get
safely away, and it seemed there were not enough
craft. True, the water was not more than three
to six feet deep, and a man, or even some strong
women swimmers, might have gotten along
safely, but frail ones, and the children, could
not.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have plenty of chance to help!” cried
Blake, as they came nearer the scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their approach was welcomed with cheers by
those in peril.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurray for the motor boat!” yelled one enthusiastic
lad—enthusiastic even in peril. His
house was three or four dwellings removed from
those already burning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll take you off!” shouted Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s the way!” cried one of the men in
the small boats. “Just run ’em over to the high
ground, and come back for more. We will have
to put up tents to house ’em, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>Clytie</i> was steered close to a burning
house, and the anxious eyes of those aboard her
sought for signs of life. There were no persons
at the windows, however, and they were
about to pass on to the next, the roof of which
was just beginning to blaze, from the sparks
falling on it, when Joe cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s someone!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little girl!” added Blake, as he saw the
figure of a child at an upper window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jump!” called Mr. Ringold, while he
reversed the propeller, to hold back the boat
against the force of the current. “Jump, little
girl!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I’m afraid!” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll save you!” added Mr. Piper, holding
out his arms encouragingly. “Jump, the water
won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must get a picture of this,” murmured
Blake. “There are enough others to aid in the
rescue work, and I’ll leave the camera, and help,
the minute I’m needed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it’s too good a chance to miss,” agreed
Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, while the child hesitated at the window,
the flames increased. Blake got the moving picture
camera into action.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come! You must jump!” called Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>The child hesitated a moment longer, and then,
as a backward look into the house showed her the
raging fire coming nearer, she burst into tears,
and climbed out on the window sill. Waiting
there a moment she let herself drop, feet foremost,
into the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Watch her!” cried Mr. Ringold, as he remained
at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The child disappeared beneath the surface of
the muddy water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got her!” yelled Mr. Piper, as she
bobbed up a moment later, and he hauled her
aboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you’re all right, little one,” he said,
soothingly, as he cuddled her in his arms.
“We’ll take care of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to get out of here,” shouted the
manager. “It is getting too hot!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They had drifted in close to a burning house—so
close, in fact, that blazing brands fell on the
deck of the boat. But they were quickly extinguished
by Joe. Blake continued to grind away
at the camera, getting a series of remarkable pictures
of the burning houses in the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The small boats, having taken their loads of
refugees to safety, returned to continue the
work, and the <i>Clytie</i> was steered on down the
row of houses to where others were waiting to
be saved.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dwelling after dwelling was emptied of its
occupants, and soon the motor boat was laden to
the limit of safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll take ’em to high ground, and come
back!” said the manager, as he turned the bow
of the craft up a side street, that led to the hills
back of the town.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went in as near shore as was safe, and
then those whom our friends had saved were
taken off on an improvised raft, and cared for
by volunteers who had hastily organized to help
in this time of stress and trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The fire will soon burn itself out,” remarked
Blake, as they went back to it again. “I’ll get
all the pictures I can, though.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There were only a few more houses left in
the row that had started to burn, and when the
last of these was gone there was a wide space
which would preclude the possibility of more
being devoured by the flames—at least until another
blaze started.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was nothing that could be done to check
the conflagration. In fact, as the boys learned
later, the town was without fire protection, save
a volunteer company, with a hand engine, and
this was, of course, useless in the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Proceeding to a house at a point below which
the small boats were engaged in rescue work,
those aboard the <i>Clytie</i> saved a number of women
and children. These were taken to a place of
safety, and another trip back made.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There goes the last house!” cried Blake, as
the final one in the row caught.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and there’s a woman signaling to us!”
added Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two of ’em!” yelled Mr. Piper, as he caught
sight of two forms at a third-story window.
This house was all aflame on one side, from
the water’s edge to the roof, but it had not yet
kindled on the side where the women appeared.
They had made their way to the top floor, perhaps
on account of fire being below them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jump!” yelled Blake, as he put aside his
camera, for the reel of film had run out, and he
did not want to stop to thread in more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, jump!” added Mr. Ringold. “We’ll
save you—it’s your only chance!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m coming!” answered one woman, and she
made a dive into some deep water an instant later,
evidently being an accomplished swimmer. She
came up near the motor boat, and was promptly
taken in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on!” cried Mr. Ringold to the other
woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>She hesitated, and drew back, evidently being
in great fear, and she seemed to be saying something,
for her lips could be seen to move.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must jump!” the manager shouted, as
he slowly backed the boat to keep her as nearly
as possible in a favorable position for picking up
the woman when she dived.</p>

<p class='c008'>She gave a backward look into the house, and
what she saw must have caused her to make up
her mind, for she prepared to leap into the flood
below her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The one who had been at the window with
her, having gotten her breath after her leap,
added her entreaties to those aboard the <i>Clytie</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jump, Mary! Jump!” she begged. “It’s
your only chance!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman at the window hesitated no longer.
She tumbled, rather than dived, into the water,
but the rescuers were on the alert, and though
the woman came up some little distance from
the craft, Blake, with a boathook, caught her
dress, and pulled her close enough so that Mr.
Piper could haul her aboard. Then the <i>Clytie</i>
was put in motion, for the house was burning
fast, and her position was anything but safe.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a few moments after her rescue, the second
woman thus saved was hysterical. But her
companion attended her, and soon she was more
like herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll be all right in a little while,” said Mr.
Piper. “We’ll take you to high ground, and the
good women there will look after you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what a terrible time it has been—fire
and flood!” murmured the one called Mary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It certainly has been, but the Lord is good
to us—he sent these kind men and boys to save
us,” the other added, as she looked at Blake and
Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If only He would give me back my little
boy,” sobbed the second woman saved. “But oh,
the flood has taken him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sobbed on her companion’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, there,” soothed the other, “you may
find him some day. Don’t take on so, Mary.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t help it, Ellen. Oh, my poor boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was evident that she was referring to some
previous loss. Charlie, who had been in the
darkened cabin, started suddenly as he heard
the voice of the woman called Mary. He
now came out on the open deck, and stared curiously
at her. And the woman, who was supporting
the head of the other on her shoulder,
looked at Charlie.</p>

<p class='c008'>A change came over her face. She tried to
speak but could not. Finally she did manage to
gasp:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mary! Look! Look! Here’s Charlie now!
Here’s your boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The woman raised her tear-stained face. For
a moment she did not comprehend, and then, as
a look of great joy showed itself in her eyes, she
held out her arms, crying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“My boy! My boy! Charlie! Is it possible!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And as for the little lad, with one glad cry,
he threw himself into her loving clasp, sobbing
over and over again:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mamma! Mamma! Oh, I am so glad!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />A BOLT FROM THE SKY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Blake, Joe and the others looked on in bewildered
surprise at this touching scene. That
Charlie should have found his mother in this
fashion seemed scarcely possible, yet such was
the fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>For several moments mother and son were in
each other’s arms, murmuring over and over
again their protestations of love, and words of
wonderment at the meeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did you find him?” the mother finally
demanded, of our friends aboard the motor boat.
“Oh, where ever did you find him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We got him out of a house, just as we did
you,” said Mr. Ringold, “only it was an upside-down
house, and not a burning one. And so
he is really your lost boy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course he is!” she cried, while Charlie
added:</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s my mamma! I’m awful glad you
found her for me. Where have you been,
Mamma?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a long story,” she sighed. “But first
I want to hear about you. Oh, I thought I
would never see you again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It won’t take long to tell all we know about
it,” said Mr. Ringold, and he related the facts of
the rescue of the boy they had christened Charlie
House.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His name is Charlie Wentworth,” explained
his mother, “and that was our house from which
you saved him. It’s strange he did not know his
last name, and where he lived, for he has often
been lost, and he could always tell where he
lived all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess the flood frightened him,” said
Blake, with a smile. “How did he happen to
be left in the house?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was because of the confusion of the flood
in our town,” explained Mrs. Wentworth. “My
husband and I were trying to save some of our
things, taking them to my mother’s place on a
hill. We had taken Charlie to a neighbor’s
house before the water actually reached our
dwelling, but he must have wandered back into
it again when we did not know it, and have gone
to sleep in the bed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yep. I went to sleep in bed,” supplemented
the lad, with a happy laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then the levee gave way suddenly,” went on
his mother, “and our house, and several others,
were carried away. My husband and I supposed
Charlie was safe at the neighbor’s until we got
there and found him missing. We were frantic,
and searched everywhere for him, never dreaming
he was in our own house. Then the flood
grew worse and we had to flee to high ground.
We gave him up for drowned. Oh, it does not
seem possible that I have him again!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is your husband now?” asked Mr.
Ringold, as he guided the boat toward the place
where the other rescued persons had been landed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We came on to this town, where my sister
lived,” went on Mrs. Wentworth. “This is my
sister,” she added, nodding toward the woman
who had first dived into the flood. “We had
to take refuge with her, as we had no other home,
and we did not think the flood would come here
also. But it did, and it brought my little boy
to me!” she cried, as again she clasped him in
her arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My husband is out, doing relief work,” she
resumed, after a moment. “We heard a rumor,
this morning, that some children had been rescued
from a raft farther down the river and he
went down there to investigate, thinking, and
hoping against hope, that our Charlie might be
one of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He will be more than surprised when he
comes back to find my sister’s house burned in
the flood, and that I have Charlie. Oh, I wish
he were here now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to see papa!” broke in Charlie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so you shall, my dear boy, as soon as
he comes back. I expect him to-night,” said
Mrs. Wentworth. “Oh, I cannot thank you
enough—ever!” and she gazed fondly at our
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wasn’t anything,” said Mr. Ringold.
“We happened to visit the house out of curiosity,
and of course we brought Charlie away
when we found him. He’s a brave little chap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later the temporary camp, on the high
ground, was reached, and there Mrs. Wentworth,
her sister and son were cared for by loving hands.
The others who had been saved from the burning
houses were also being looked after.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I guess we’ve done all we can here,”
said Blake, as they prepared to resume their journey
down the river.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blazing houses were burning themselves
out, down to the edge of the water, and the
danger from the flames was over. But the peril
of the flood still remained, for the waters slowly
continued to rise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We found Charlie’s folks,” remarked Joe,
when they had bidden an affectionate farewell to
the boy’s mother, aunt and others of the rescued
ones, “we found Charlie’s folks, but we can’t
seem to locate our own friends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet we may find them in just as unexpected
a manner as we found Mrs. Wentworth,”
spoke C. C. “I tell you I’m mighty glad we
happened along when we did. It’s just like a
story out of a book.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It would make a good moving picture, if we
could show it all complete,” spoke Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It could be worked up into a drama, with
the flood scenes you have,” declared the theatrical
manager. “I could film the missing scenes
later. I believe I will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’ll be one happy father to-night,” observed
Joe, thoughtfully. “When Mr. Wentworth
comes back, unsuccessful, and finds his
son, he sure will be happy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll miss the little chap,” spoke Blake.
“He was as good as gold while he was with us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the chance that there might still be some
in need of rescue in the town where the houses
had burned, the <i>Clytie</i> went back through the
flooded streets, but men in small boats were patrolling
the district, and, thanking our friends for
their work, said they would look after matters
now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there won’t be much left to look after,
if this keeps on,” spoke one man, gloomily
enough, as he looked over the burned section,
and the flooded village. “We’ve been smitten
mighty hard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we’ll come up again, when the waters
go down!” cried another, more cheerfully. “It
might be worse. No lives have been lost, so
far, that’s one blessing!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a good way to look at it,” said Mr.
Ringold, as he directed the craft out into the
main flood again, and turned her bow down
stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they were all tired, and wet from the work
of rescuing those who had leaped into the water,
it was decided to make a stop, tie up, have something
to eat, and clean the boat, for there was
much mud and water aboard from the clothing
of the saved ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Accordingly, in a sheltered cove, tied to a tree
that stuck up out of the flood, they made a halt.
The preparation of the meal, and the cleansing
of the boat took longer than they expected, and
as Blake wanted to get some pictures of that
flooded section, they decided to remain there
over night, and proceed in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The weather had cleared again, at least for
the time being, and, aside from their anxiety
about the missing ones, our friends were fairly
comfortable. They had put on dry clothing, and
sat in the cabin of the boat, discussing the strenuous
scenes through which they had recently
passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A loud crash awakened them all about midnight,
no watch having been kept. It sounded
like some great explosion, close at hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What was that?” cried Blake, sitting up in
his bunk.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had his answer a second later, for there
was a blinding flash, and another booming
sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thunder and lightning!” exclaimed Joe.
“It’s a storm!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later there came a deluge of rain,
that fairly roared as it struck the deck and awnings
of the boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whew!” exclaimed Blake. “This is fierce!
If this keeps up long the flood will exceed its
own high-water mark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better take a look at the cable,” suggested
Mr. Ringold. “We don’t want to get adrift in
this outburst.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake put on a raincoat, and stepped outside.
The vivid lightning, and the deafening thunder,
kept up, and he was forced to cling to the rail to
steady himself against the motion of the craft,
and the force of the wind. The <i>Clytie</i> was tugging
hard at her mooring cable, which was
strained taut.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It wouldn’t do any harm to put on another
rope!” cried Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll do it,” answered Mr. Ringold, from
the sleeping cabin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake made his way to the cleat to which the
boat end of the rope was made fast. He saw,
with concern, that the rope was frayed, and
would not hold much longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better hurry!” he called, but he had scarcely
spoken when the very sky seemed rent with a
bolt of lightning, and, as the raging, roaring,
flooded river was lighted up by the flash, the
rope parted and the motor boat was carried away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re adrift!” yelled Blake, as intense darkness
succeeded the bright glare.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />THE COTTON BARGE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For a moment there was the utmost confusion
aboard the craft. The words of Blake, the sudden
motion as the rope broke, the tossing and
pitching, as the boat was borne on the crest of
the flood, seemed to deprive them all of the
ability to act.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake himself had nearly been carried overboard,
so suddenly did the cable part, but he
managed to grasp a rail and so saved himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you see anything?” yelled Mr. Ringold,
as he was struggling into his raincoat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only when it lightens,” answered Blake.
“It’s a fierce storm, all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The others came out on deck, and, as flash succeeded
flash, they viewed the mad scene all about
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>On raced the motor boat, a frail thing indeed
in that wild waste of waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to start the engine!” yelled Mr.
Ringold, for one needed to yell to be heard above
that storm. “It’s the only way we can be safe,”
the manager added. “Start the motor!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where will we steer?” Mr. Piper
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anywhere we can, to get in some sheltered
place,” suggested Blake. “But it’s doubtful if
we can stem this wind and current.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to quarter it,” spoke Mr. Ringold,
when he had taken an observation, by the aid of
a lightning flash.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile Joe and Mr. Piper had started the
motor, and, as the welcome throb and hum were
heard, Blake and the manager went to the wheel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better light up,” the moving picture man
said. “No telling what we may run into, or what
might run into us. There are probably boats
afloat, bad as the storm is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Save for a single light in the cabin, and a riding
light outside, the <i>Clytie</i> was in darkness when
the cable parted. But now the incandescents
were switched on. They were operated by a
large storage battery, charged by a dynamo, run
by the motor flywheel.</p>

<p class='c008'>With a powerful searchlight at her bow, her
stern light, and the red and green side lamps, as
well as the cabin lights, aglow, the craft now presented
a more cheerful aspect, and she was
certainly safer. The lights, too, helped to take away
the really terrifying effect of the vivid lightning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The place at the wheel was partitioned off, and
that little pilot house, as it were, was left in
darkness, to enable Blake and Mr. Ringold to
see to steer.</p>

<p class='c008'>They could do little, however, save to try and
cross the current in a diagonal direction, to make
their way to some sheltered cove.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This certainly is the limit!” murmured
Blake, as he stood at the manager’s side. “I
didn’t think there was any more rain left in the
clouds.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There seems to be plenty coming down,” observed
the theatrical man, grimly. They listened
to it pelting on the cabin roof. It was a constant
roar, and added to it was the thunder of
the sky artillery, following each flash, and the
never-ceasing hiss and hum of the rushing river.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll have to look out for debris as best we
can,” spoke Mr. Ringold. “There are some big
logs afloat, and if one hits us end on——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not finish, but Blake realized what he
meant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look! That struck just in front of us!”
cried the youth, as he and his companion shrank
back, instinctively, from a particularly vivid flash.</p>

<p class='c008'>His words were drowned in the shock that
followed, and indeed it was seen that the bolt had
struck the water but a little way in advance of
the boat. A smell, as of sulphur, filled the air,
and there was a sensation as though everyone
aboard the craft had received a mild electric
shock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was close enough!” murmured Joe, as
he come into the cabin, after having seen to the
oiling of the motor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so!” agreed Mr. Piper, who followed
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Try as Mr. Ringold did to send the craft out
of the main current, he seemed unable to accomplish
it. It was as though the boat were in the
grip of some powerful hand, that was shoving
her forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several times, as they fairly flew onward, the
propeller aiding the current in making speed,
those aboard felt the bumps and shocks as they
struck objects in the water. Fortunately the
debris was moving at considerable speed also,
and in the same direction as was the motor boat,
or serious damage might have been done.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There goes another hit!” cried Blake, as he
saw a second lightning bolt descend into the
water. This one, though, was far enough off so
that no unpleasant effects were felt by our
friends. The bolt from the sky, however, hit and
split wide open a big tree that was floating down
stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it strikes us,” murmured Mr. Piper,
“we’ll——” And then he thought better of what
he was evidently going to say, and did not finish
his sentence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s of no use,” said Mr. Ringold, after a
while, “We can’t make any headway across the
river. We’ll just have to go on and trust to
luck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He and Blake kept a sharp lookout ahead, and
managed to avoid, several times, collisions with
floating debris in the shape of logs, and parts of
buildings.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they rounded a turn, which could be made
out by the flashes of lightning, Blake uttered a
cry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that—just ahead?” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>He pointed to a large black object, looming up
on the right.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same moment there came another flash,
seemingly of greater intensity than any that
had preceded it. The flash appeared to completely
envelope the big, dark object, and with
one voice Blake and Mr. Ringold cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“A cotton barge!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And struck by lightning, too!” added Blake,
a second later, as, despite the downpour of rain,
flames burst from several places on the loaded
boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lightning had indeed set fire to the cotton,
which was floating down the river. It had probably
broken away from the place where it had
been moored, or from the tug that was towing
it. Rapidly the flames gained headway, and, as
there came a sudden cessation to the rain, which
might have extinguished them, the tongues of
fire leaped higher and higher.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope we will be able to keep well away
from her,” murmured Mr. Ringold, and for a
time it seemed as though they might, for
the burning barge was well in advance of our
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was a vain hope. A little later the barge
suddenly grounded on some obstruction, and remained
stationary, while the motor boat was
borne down directly on it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Steer to one side!” yelled Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m trying to!” echoed the manager, but it
was easily seen that he was not going to be able
to do this in time. A moment later the <i>Clytie</i>
poked her bow against the barge, with great
force.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately, however, a bale of cotton, hanging
partly overboard, took the brunt of the blow,
so no damage was done.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Back water!” cried Joe. “We’ll be on fire
in another minute!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It certainly seemed so, for though they had
struck the barge at a place where, for the time
being, there were no flames, the fire was rapidly
enveloping the whole cargo.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ringold pulled the reversing lever, throwing
in the gears, but the craft remained with her
bow still against the cotton barge. The force of
the current back of the <i>Clytie</i> was too much for
her to overcome. She was gradually being
swung around sideways to the barge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flames were getting hotter. They roared
and crackled, and vied with the thunder and
lightning in adding to the scene of terror.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Send her ahead!” suddenly cried Blake.
“That’s our only chance!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What for?” demanded his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We may be able to shove the barge off the
bar, or away from the snag, or whatever is holding
her. Then she’ll drift away from us. It’s
our only chance!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re right!” cried Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more he changed the lever, and now the
propeller beat the muddy water to foam, as the
bow of the motor boat pushed hard against the
side of the barge.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Blake’s advice proved to be the best. For,
hanging an instant on the bar that had caught
her, the barge suddenly gave way, and now, almost
completely wrapped in flames, she once
more started on her journey down the swirling
torrent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Mr. Ringold was able, by a quick turn
of the helm, and by speeding up the engine, to
swing to one side, and away from the burning
craft, which was left to go on to her own destruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whew! Hot work!” exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so,” agreed Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first fury of the storm seemed now to
have passed. The thunder was less heavy, and
the lightning not so vivid. The rain had started
again, but it was a mere drizzle.</p>

<p class='c008'>For several miles more the <i>Clytie</i> went on, at
the mercy of the current, and then, as the lightning
flash revealed a little cove to one side, Mr.
Ringold determined to steer for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>To his delight he found that the boat answered
her helm well, the river being wider at this point,
and the current less powerful. And then, a little
later, they were able to come into comparatively
quiet waters, where, with the aid of the searchlight,
they found a big tree, to which they tied,
and with double cables.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />OVERBOARD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what’s the program for to-day?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Down the river—more pictures—and make
all the inquiries we can about our friends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Joe who asked the question, and Blake
who answered it. The moving picture boys were
getting breakfast aboard the motor boat, which
was still safely tied to a big tree in the cove
where they had made a stop the night before,
following the fire on the cotton barge.</p>

<p class='c008'>It had stopped raining, but the sky was not
clear, and the flood was all about them, the waters
being higher than ever. There seemed to be no
cessation to the increase.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We certainly are getting a fine lot of
pictures out of it all,” murmured Joe, as he
glanced at the pile of films in the water-proof
cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that’s the one redeeming feature,”
agreed Blake, as he put the coffee on to boil.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’s the weather outside?” called Mr.
Ringold, from his bunk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing to boast of,” replied Blake.
“Looks as if it would rain more any minute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anything out there worth filming?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing much—a lot of stuff coming down
the river, but we’ve got enough of that,” spoke
Joe. “I only wish we could have filmed the burning
cotton barge, but we had enough to do as it
was, to get clear of it ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so,” came from Blake, as he
recalled the danger of the night before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Breakfast over, preparations were made for
again moving down stream. The boys got the
camera ready to take any scenes that might be
worth filming, and Mr. Ringold and C. C. took
charge of the boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the lines were being cast off, there came
rowing along the stream, close in to shore, so as
to keep out of the strong current, a farmer in a
skiff. He seemed somewhat surprised to see our
friends, but hailed them, asking:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I say, you folks ain’t seen nothin’ of a spotted
cow critter around here; have you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A cow? No,” answered Blake. “We saw
one floating down in a barn a day or so ago.
Was she yours?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, my barn’s still on land, but my spotted
cow critter is missin’ and I thought maybe you
folks might have seen her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’d have to be swimming if she was
around here,” remarked Joe, looking at the waste
of water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I reckon so,” agreed the farmer. “She
jest naturally likes to wander off, that spotted
cow critter of mine does. I guess she’ll be
drowned some day. Well, I’ll look a little farther,
and then I’ll git back. Water’s gittin’
higher all the while. Where you folks bound
for?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No place in particular,” Blake informed
him. “We’re looking for some friends of ours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s been a good many lost in this flood,”
the farmer said. “I had two hens and a rooster
drowned in the last flood. I lived on low ground
then. I’ve moved back a piece since. I’m hopin’
the water don’t come up to me now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there any town near by—below here?”
asked Mr. Ringold. Their supplies were getting
low, and needed replenishing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, quite a good sized one about three mile
down the river. The folks is workin’ hard too,
to keep the water out. There’s a big shipment of
cotton on the wharves waitin’ for a boat to take
it off, I hear. But if she don’t come pretty soon
the cotton will go floatin’ off by itself. They
can’t git no help to move it back, ’cause all the
men are busy on the levee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That might make a good picture for us,”
suggested Blake to Joe, when they had called
good-bye to the farmer who was looking for his
“spotted cow critter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe it would,” agreed Joe. “We’ll have
a try at it, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kill two birds with one stone,” said Mr.
Ringold, “we’ll get supplies, and pictures too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They started down stream, proceeding with
care, for there was an unusual quantity of debris
in the river—logs, part of lumber rafts, dismantled
houses, barns and sheds. But the <i>Clytie</i>
was navigated safely through it all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our friends had gone about a mile, when,
as they went around a wooded point of land,
they saw a curious sight. It was a large steamer,
stranded inland, about a quarter of a mile from
the water. It was listed to one side, and about
it were many men, engaged in digging a trench,
or canal, so as to float the craft back into the
stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what do you know about that?” cried
Joe, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Got to film her, all right!” declared Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How could such a thing happen?” C. C.
Piper wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They probably went through a ‘cut-off,’”
explained Mr. Ringold, “and must have gone
aground. Then, before they could float her, the
waters took a new direction, made a new channel,
and left the steamer where she is. I’ve read
of such things, but never saw one. We’ll go
over and find out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The motor boat was directed to a point nearest
the inland steamer, and, taking the camera,
Blake and Joe went ashore, followed by the manager
and actor.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, while the boys were taking moving pictures
of the men at work digging the trench, to
bring the river to the steamer, since the boat refused
to go to the water, Mr. Ringold questioned
the captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s about how it happened,” the latter
said, when the manager had asked about the accident.
“I tried a short cut, and we anchored
for the night right about here. I s’posed I’d have
water enough to go on in the morning, and maybe
save about ten miles by this ‘cut-off.’ But, by
George! When we tried to start in the morning
we found the waters going down, and, before we
knew it, we were high and dry. I don’t know as
we’ll ever get afloat now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed it did look like a hopeless task, but the
men were working hard to take advantage of the
high water. Once the flood subsided the steamer
might never be floated, until another period of
unusually heavy rain set in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I guess we’ve got enough of this,”
remarked Blake, as he took the final scenes at the
steamer. “Now for some views in the village
below.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more they were under way, and a little
later they came in sight of the town, which was
the principal shipping port for cotton in that vicinity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, there’s a big crowd working there!”
exclaimed Joe, as they headed for the levee, only
a small part of which was out of water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, there’s a big crowd there, but look at
the few who are working at the cotton,” spoke
Blake. “There’s a big pile of it, and it’ll take
those few men a good while to move it. The
water’s rising fast, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The levee at this town was a sloping one,
faced with cobble stones, and when the river
was low, horses and wagons were driven down
it to the landing stages of the steamers. There
were no permanent docks, except on the very
top of the levee, and it was there the cotton was
stored.</p>

<p class='c008'>The absence of permanent docks, or wharves,
close to the water was due to the sudden rise and
fall of the stream at this point. Sometimes the
steamers could come up to the permanent
wharves, at the top of the levee. At others they
were some distance off, and goods had to be
moved down the slope in wagons, to the temporary
landing stages, thrown out by the boats.</p>

<p class='c008'>The danger to the town, should the levee give
way, was so evident, that every available man had
been called on to strengthen the sloping bank,
which kept back the waters. The owners of the
cotton, it seems, had appealed in vain for help in
moving their cargo back out of danger, and so
they were obliged to do the work themselves.
And it was no easy matter to handle the big,
clumsy bales.</p>

<p class='c008'>The motor boat was tied where it would not
be in the way, and, from the bow, Joe and Blake
took a series of moving pictures while Mr. Ringold
and C. C. went ashore to get some supplies,
and make inquiries regarding the missing theatrical
company.</p>

<p class='c008'>In regard to the latter, however, they received
no satisfaction. Nothing had been seen or heard
of them. The telegraph line, however, was in
good working order, and Mr. Ringold sent a
message to his New York office, asking if any
news had been received from the missing ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll wait for a reply,” he said. “It ought
not to take many hours, and we can easily spare
the time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Joe,” remarked Blake, when they had filmed
several views of the scenes at the levee, “suppose
we take the boat down stream a short distance.
I want to get nearer to the piles of cotton, so they
will show up well on the screen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. I can work the boat, and you can
manage the camera.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ringold and the actor were up in the town,
but the manager had told the boys they might
move the boat about as they pleased in getting
pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>Accordingly Joe cast off the line, started the
motor and headed the craft nearer to the cotton
wharf.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold her there now!” cried Blake, as he
took a position at the bow with the camera.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was grinding away at the handle, paying
no attention to the boat, or river, when suddenly
a swirl of the current carried a big log directly
against the bow of the craft. She was being
headed slowly up stream, Joe working the motor
only fast enough to maintain a slight headway.</p>

<p class='c008'>There came a jar that shook the <i>Clytie</i> from
stem to stern.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out!” yelled Joe to Blake, but the
warning came too late. The young moving picture
operator shot overboard, into the muddy
water, the camera clattering to the deck behind
him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />A COLLISION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Man overboard!” yelled Joe, more from a
sudden instinct than because there was anyone
beside himself on the boat to be informed of the
fact. Then, with a leap, Joe was outside the pilot
house, and standing in the bow of the still-moving
craft.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe had caught up, in his rush, a cork life ring,
attached to a rope, one being kept on the forward
deck in readiness for any emergency in the flood.
The young operator shoved the fallen camera to
one side, and peered eagerly down for a sight
of his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here you go, Blake!” Joe cried, a hasty
glance toward shore showing him two men coming
in a rowboat, in response to his cries. “Here
you go! Grab this!”</p>

<p class='c008'>For he had a glimpse of Blake’s head emerging
from the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake was a good swimmer, but he was
handicapped by his clothes and shoes, and the fact that
the current was rather swift.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young operator shook his head, to rid his
eyes of the blinding water, and then reached out
for the ring which Joe tossed to him. He caught
it in one hand, and then was quickly pulled toward
the boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All—all right—Joe—good—work!” Blake
managed to gasp.</p>

<p class='c008'>A moment later he was safe on deck, and Joe
had to run back in a hurry to the steering wheel,
for the <i>Clytie</i> was headed directly for the small
boat. The men in it were crying out in alarm,
and endeavoring to get out of the way. But the
unguided motor craft seemed bent on running
them down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right! Don’t worry!” shouted Joe, as
he twirled over the steering wheel, and changed
the course of the boat. “I guess we’d better go
back and tie up,” he added. “Did you get
enough pictures, Blake?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ll call it a day’s work,” panted
the young operator, as he managed to get a full
breath after his sudden bath. “I was almost finished
when that bump came and knocked me
overboard. What was it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A big log. I didn’t see it in time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neither did I, or I’d have taken a brace,”
said Blake, grimly. “Well,” he went on, as he
picked up the camera, and found that it was
not damaged, “I guess I’ll change my clothes.
These don’t look just fit for going to a party,”
and he laughed. The camera had closed automatically
when he ceased grinding at the crank,
so no pictures were spoiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can we do anything?” asked one of the men
in the boat. They were working on the levee,
and had dropped everything, and pushed off in
their craft, when Joe’s cry of alarm reached
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you—no. It’s all over,” said Blake,
as Joe guided the motor boat back to her moorings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing worse than a wetting was the result
of Blake’s tumble overboard, and soon, in dry
clothing, he was ready for whatever came next.
As they had enough pictures of the work on the
levee, and at the cotton wharf, the boys decided
to await the return of Mr. Ringold and the actor,
who had now been gone some time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose we go up to town ourselves,” suggested
Blake, after a bit. “It will give us a
chance to stretch our legs, and we can help carry
back the rest of the supplies,” for the latter had
not all been put on board yet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m with you,” agreed Joe; and, seeing that
their craft was securely moored, they went
ashore.</p>

<p class='c008'>The town was a fairly large one, and contained
several stores. But business was practically at a
standstill now, for everyone who could was
working at the levee. There were anxious looks
on the faces of all—men, women and children.
But women and children were about the only
ones in the streets, the men all being at the river
front.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look!” exclaimed Joe, pointing to a moving
picture theater. It was closed, probably from
lack of patronage during the flood season, but in
front were some advertising lithographs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some of our films!” cried Blake, as he saw
some gaudily-colored representations of those
pictures he and Joe had taken in earthquake
land.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So they are!” echoed Joe. “Who’d ever
thought of seeing them here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder how they took with the audiences?”
went on Blake, for he always interested
in the financial end of their business, and he and
his chum really tried hard to get the very best
sort of moving pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d sort of like to know that, myself,” murmured
Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>A small boy was standing in front of the
lithographs of the colored pictures, looking at them
interestedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you like to go in? What time does
the show start?” asked Blake, handing the boy
a dime, which he took eagerly, and wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would I like to go in, mister? Well, I guess
I would. But they ain’t givin’ no shows while
the river’s risin’. Nobody comes and the feller
what runs the place says it don’t pay him to open.
But I saw them pictures,” and he nodded at the
ones showing a volcano in eruption, and the
ground quaking—views that Blake and Joe had
taken at a great personal risk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How’d you like ’em?” asked Joe, winking
at Blake over the lad’s head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, they was the bulliest pictures ever I see,
and I go to all the shows when I can!” he cried
with enthusiasm. “They was certainly some pictures,
believe me! I would like to have been
there myself, only not too close,” he added, with
caution. “The fellers who took them movies
sure must have had nerve. I’d like to meet ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We took those pictures,” said Blake, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lad looked at him for a moment. Then a
curious look came over his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!” he remarked in withering tones, “I’m
much obliged to you for the dime—I sure am,
’cause I don’t git many. But there ain’t no call
for you to try to string me that way—jest ’cause
you slipped me a dime.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we did take those pictures,” insisted Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy edged away, as though he were afraid
they might take strenuous measures to compel
him to believe them. Then, as a parting shot,
he called out:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Much obliged for the dime, but I ain’t as
green as I look, mister. You take them pictures?
Bah! Think I’ll believe that?” And he set off
on the run.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess we might have better kept still,”
spoke Blake, with a grin at his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess so, too. I s’pose it was asking rather
too much to get him to believe a couple of strange
fellows took those views. And do you know,
Blake,” went on Joe, “sometimes when I get to
thinking about what we’ve gone through since we
used to work on the farm, I can hardly believe
it myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right. The stunts we did in New
York were strenuous enough for a starter, but in
the jungle, and in earthquake land—good night!—as
the poet says!” exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And this is going to be worse, if I’m any
judge,” went on Joe, as he nodded in the direction
of the flooded river.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Guess you’re right,” agreed his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>They kept on through the town, making a few
purchases in stores where women were the only
clerks, the men being down at the levee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There they are!” exclaimed Joe, as he and
Blake turned into the main street, from a side
one, and caught sight of Mr. Ringold and C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They look as though something had happened,”
observed Blake, as he noticed their
friends hurrying toward them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe they heard about you falling overboard,
but didn’t hear of your rescue,” suggested
his companion. But it was not that, as the boys
learned a moment later.</p>

<p class='c008'>Waving a slip of paper over his head, Mr.
Ringold cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got news, boys! News of our missing
friends!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Really!” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, they heard from them in the New York
office. I just received a telegram. It’s quite a
story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are they?” Blake wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somewhere down the river,” answered Mr.
Ringold. “A message came from them in a bottle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A bottle!” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. They must have been carried down on
the flood, and only had time to write a hasty message
and fling it, stopped up in a bottle, into the
river. Here’s a long telegram from the New
York office. I’ll condense what it says.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then it’s really news from them—from Birdie
Lee and the others?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It surely is,” answered the manager. “What
happened after they went to the island to make
moving pictures isn’t stated. But a few days ago
this telegram came to the New York office.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He then read:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are being carried down the river on part
of a house that was washed away in the sudden
flood. We are all together, but suffering very
much. The waters rose very suddenly. Cannot
tell where we will land. I am writing this and
putting it in a bottle, which I will throw into the
flood. Someone may pick it up and transmit it
to you. Come to us if you can!”</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment the boys were silent, and then
Blake asked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did the message get to New York?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had to make inquiries to find that out,” replied
Mr. Ringold. “It seems that the bottle
was washed ashore and picked up by a colored
man. He took it to his employer, who read the
messages inside. They were signed by Mr.
Levinberg, who also put in a five-dollar bill, to
insure the sending of the telegram. With the
note he wrote for transmission to me was one
asking the finder of the bottle to take the message
to the nearest telegraph office.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But where was the bottle picked up? Where
may we expect to find our friends?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somewhere below here, I think,” said Mr.
Ringold. “The message was sent from a telegraph
office about a hundred miles above here.
Our friends probably drifted on the flood near
there. They are still in the—beyond——” and
he motioned to the flooded section lying to the
South.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then let’s start!” cried Joe. “Every minute
counts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With the provisions aboard, a new supply of
gasoline, and with the films Blake was taking
when he went overboard safely put away in
water proof cases, the rescuers once more took
up their voyage.</p>

<p class='c008'>The remainder of the day they kept on down
the flooded river. Several times they came within
a short distance of big pieces of debris, and collisions
were narrowly averted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The afternoon wore away and dusk settled
down. It began to rain again, and it was rather
a discouraged party that looked out from the
cabin of the <i>Clytie</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Worse and more of it,” murmured Blake,
who was at the steering wheel. “Will it ever
stop?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, now! None of that C. C. stuff!”
spoke Joe with a laugh. “Things will come out
all right yet. It’s something to have had news of
our friends, when we didn’t expect any.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but think of the plight they must be in—floating
down this river in some house, that
may go to pieces any minute!” cried Blake. “It’s
terrible—for Birdie and the others. The men
may be able to stand it. But the ladies——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, perhaps they are rescued by this time,”
said Joe, cheerfully. “That message was dated
several days ago, you notice. And it must have
been two or three days afloat. I have a feeling,
somehow, that we’ll find them all right.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I sure do hope so,” spoke Blake.
“Pshaw! I oughn’t to be this way!” he exclaimed.
“I must look on the brighter side.
Perhaps they are all right, after all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They ate supper in the enclosed cabin, for there
was a cold drizzle of rain that made going outside
unpleasant. No one felt much like talking,
but the unexpected news had, in a measure,
cheered them up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If they could only have given us some definite
clew,” spoke Mr. Ringold. “I’d do anything
I could to rescue them. But it is like
searching in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And, speaking of the dark, reminds me that
it will soon be dark here, and we’ll have to look
for some place to tie up,” remarked Blake. “I
think we’d better be getting over toward shore.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I agree with you,” said Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took the wheel, relieving Joe, who had not
yet eaten. The craft was directed over toward
the eastern shore, and a sharp lookout was kept
for some sheltered cove where the night could be
spent.</p>

<p class='c008'>It grew darker rapidly, and the rain increased
in violence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a lot of stuff coming down,” observed
Blake, as he stood at the wheel, beside Mr. Ringold.
“More debris than we’ve seen in some
time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” agreed the manager. “There’s
an island just below us,” he added. “I wonder
if, by any chance, our friends could have landed
on that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We might stop there and see,” suggested
Blake. “It might be a good place to spend the
night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll try it, at any rate,” Mr. Ringold said.</p>

<p class='c008'>The island, now that the waters had risen on
all sides of it, was rather small.</p>

<p class='c008'>The motor boat was steered along the Western
shore of it, but a nearer view showed that
there could, by no possibility, be any one on it.
For it was long and narrow, and a view could
be had entirely across it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess we won’t stop—there’s no one there,”
the manager said, as he veered the boat away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—there’s no sign of them,” agreed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were approaching the foot of the island—that
is, the down stream end, and, as the motor
boat shot past it, carried by the powerful current,
and her propeller, Blake uttered a cry of
alarm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out for that raft!” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ringold looked in time to see a big lumber
raft, unmanned and uncontrolled, coming
down on the other side of the island. It turned
the lower end just as the motor did, and before
those on board the craft could do anything to
avoid the danger, the raft had collided with them,
striking the <i>Clytie</i> on the starboard bow with a
resounding crash.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boat heeled over, and seemed about to
capsize.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c006'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />ON THE RAFT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“We’re sinking!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get out the life preservers!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Save the films and cameras!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And grab something to eat! Don’t forget
that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus cried those aboard the <i>Clytie</i>, for it was
evident that the stanch craft had made her last
voyage. She was careened at a dangerous angle,
and her motor had stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The raft ripped a big hole in the bow!”
shouted Mr. Ringold, who, with Blake, had been
thrown against the side of the pilot house, and
was somewhat stunned by the shock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are we sinking?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, but it is only a question of a few minutes.
We must save ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And our outfit—if we can,” said Joe. “What
shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A hasty examination showed that the jagged
front logs of the raft had been driven completely
into the motor boat, staving in her planking,
through which the water was rushing. And, so
violent had been the blow of the collision that
the <i>Clytie</i> was actually impaled on the floating
tree trunks, that were bound together with
ropes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take to the raft!” cried Mr. Ringold. “It’s
our only chance!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right!” shouted C. C. “Come on,
boys! Load all we can on the raft!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The water was now up over the cabin floor.
It was evident that she was going down fast.
Only the fact that the raft stuck part way
through her held her up. Once filled with
water, as she soon must be, she would pull
herself loose by her own weight, and go to the
bottom of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Food first, water—and something for a
light!” cried Mr. Ringold, issuing his orders
calmly. “Then, if you can, boys, save the
cameras and films.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we’ll save them!” exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so!” murmured Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>A keg of water, some packages of food, and
two lanterns were hastily lifted over the side of
the motor boat, and placed on the raft. Then
some blankets, bedding and other things were
tossed over in a pile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now the cameras and films!” yelled Blake.
“Get on the raft, Joe, and I’ll pass them to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Stopping only to gather up a few personal belongings,
Joe leaped to the surface of the raft.
It had been a large one, though only part of it
remained now, and it was well up out of the
water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here you go!” cried Blake, as he handed
down the reels of exposed film. And how glad
Blake was that they had taken the precaution to
wrap them in oil-cloth! For it was raining, and
he had to lay the reels down on the raft, where
the water would drizzle on them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any more?” asked Joe, as he came back
from the center of the log raft, where he had
piled the things Blake handed to him out of the
motor boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The cameras now. They’re loaded, so be
careful of them. We may get a chance to take
more views,” spoke Blake, hopefully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It doesn’t seem so,” commented Joe, as he
glanced at the sinking <i>Clytie</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ringold and C. C. were busy saving what
they could to give aid and comfort while aboard
the raft. It could not be much, for there was
little time to spare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s going!” warned the actor, as he
passed out another roll of blankets and bedding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think she is,” agreed the manager, as the
impaled motor boat gave a lurch, and pulled
partly away from the raft. She was filling rapidly
with water, and the great weight of that,
as well as the weight of the motor, was dragging
down the hapless <i>Clytie</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on! Jump!” urged the actor to Mr.
Ringold and Blake, who were aboard the sinking
boat. “No time to lose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake paused only long enough to grab up a
light rifle, and some cartridges, which were in
the cabin, and then he leaped to the raft.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was followed by Mr. Ringold, and
none too soon, for, a moment later, with a
rending of planks, the motor boat pulled away
from the jagged ends of the raft on which she
was impaled.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second’s hesitation, and she sank with a
gurgling, bubbling sound beneath the muddy,
swirling waters of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-bye, <i>Clytie</i>!” said Blake, softly, and
it was as though he was saying farewell to
some dear friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I guess we’ve seen the last of her,”
murmured Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>They stood silent for a minute, huddled together,
a wet, miserable group on the big raft
that was racing down stream. Then, as he gazed
at his companions, and then at the pile of their
possessions, C. C. Piper remarked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“What happened, anyhow? What does it all
mean? Is it a dream or reality?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s real, all right,” spoke Joe, mournfully
enough. “We were rammed by this raft—that’s
what happened. And it’s lucky for us that these
logs stood by long enough for us to get aboard,
or we’d be swimming out there in the big muddy,”
and he nodded toward the river, from which
they were kept by none too stout a craft.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s my fault,” said Mr. Ringold. “I should
have seen this raft racing along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, let’s see what sort of a boat the raft’s
going to make for us,” interrupted Joe. “We’ve
got to stay aboard to-night, at all events.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and maybe longer,” added Blake.
“Well, there’s a cabin to take shelter in, anyhow.
Let’s take a look at that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded toward the stern of the raft, and,
looming up in the darkness, could be seen a sort
of shack, or shanty. It was where the raftmen
did their cooking, eating and sleeping, while
navigating the big collection of logs down the
river.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s see what sort of place it is,” Blake
went on. “Maybe there are bunks in it, and a
stove where we can cook what stuff we’ve got
left,” and he looked at the little pile of food
they had been able to save from the sinking boat.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />ADRIFT AGAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Not so bad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right! It might be a whole lot
worse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s rough, but we can stand it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to. There’s no going ashore while
this flood keeps up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, in turn, Blake, Joe, Mr. Ringold and
C. C. commented, as they stood in the doorway
of the slab shack erected on the stern of the
lumber raft. Blake had lighted the lantern he
had taken the precaution to save from the sinking
motor boat, and this gave light enough to
see the interior of the cabin that must be their
abiding place, for how long they could not tell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there’s a place where we can stretch
out, anyhow,” said Blake, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And a stove to cook on, and plenty of wood
for fires,” added Joe, as he looked down at the
raft. “It won’t be so bad, after all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The slab cabin was a roomy one, made to accommodate
at least half a dozen men, for there
were that many bunks. There were rude chairs,
a couple of tables, and some cooking utensils and
dishes. Evidently the crew that had been bringing
the raft down stream had counted on being
aboard for some time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They must have gone off in a hurry,” commented
Mr. Ringold, for some of the chairs were
overturned, and there were the remains of a
meal, partially consumed, on the table. Articles
of clothing were scattered about, and the bed
coverings were tossed back on some of the bunks,
as though the sleepers had hurried out, without
waiting to stop and gather up their belongings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There must have been some sort of accident
to the raft,” observed Mr. Piper. “Probably it
was suddenly caught in the rising flood, and
maybe it collided with a boat, or another raft.
Part of it was carried away, that’s evident from
the jagged end that hit us. And I reckon the
men fairly jumped overboard, leaving everything
here just as we see it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s probably the explanation,” agreed
the manager. “Well, let’s get our things in out
of the rain, and see what we can do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was showering heavily now, and the boys
were more glad than ever that they had taken
the precaution of wrapping the films in waterproof
coverings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some other lanterns were found in the cabin,
and, being filled with oil, they were lighted and
hung up on the walls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We ought to show a light outside, too, I
suppose,” said Blake, reflectively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so, to avoid being run down by a
passing steamer,” said Mr. Ringold, “though I
don’t believe many vessels will take a chance of
navigating the river when it’s in this condition.
Still, it’s best to be on the safe side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a pole about amidships of the raft,
evidently intended to be used for displaying a
light, and a lantern was put as high on this as
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time our friends had brought into the
cabin the things they had so hastily removed
from the motor boat, and then they sat down to
consider matters, and decide on some course of
procedure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“First of all,” began Mr. Piper, “we
must——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have something to eat!” interrupted Blake.
“There’s dry wood in here, and a stove. I see
a coffee pot, and I know we brought some ground
coffee—not much, but some. Where’s that keg
of fresh water?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here,” replied Joe, who had brought it in.
“It won’t go very far, though.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed the water supply was going to be a
serious matter, though, if worse came to worst,
they could use the river water, by allowing it to
stand for some hours, to settle. It was fresh,
but full of mud, and unpleasant to taste and
smell. They could also catch the rain as it fell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I saw a barrel outside the shack,” spoke Mr.
Ringold. “Maybe that has water in it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll look!” offered Blake. “It has!” he cried
a moment later, “and it’s fresh water, too. That
will last us some days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then go ahead, and make coffee,” suggested
Joe, “and we’ll see what else there is here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An inspection of the cabin showed that there
was some food left. It was not very choice, but
it was better than nothing, consisting of canned
stuff, and, with what our friends had managed
to take off their sinking boat, would do for a
while.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fire was soon crackling in the rather dilapidated
stove, and the odor of coffee, fragrant and
appetizing, filled the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, this isn’t so bad,” remarked Blake, as
he sat munching a canned corned beef sandwich.
“We’re pretty snug in here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and we don’t have to worry about
running a motor, or sinking,” added Joe. “We
can’t sink. I really like this better than the
<i>Clytie</i>, after all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You might—if you say it quick!” spoke
Blake, half-sarcastically. “Still we’re a good
deal better off here than out there,” and he nodded
toward the river.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the question is: What’s going to become
of us?” asked C. C. “We can’t stay here for
ever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody wants to,” said Blake. “But we’ve
got to—for a while; until we’re taken off, anyhow.
We certainly can’t swim to shore. We’re
about in the middle of the river now, and this
is several miles wide. We’ve got to make the
best of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can’t do anything but let her drift,” said
Mr. Ringold. “The sweep, or steering oar, is
gone, though we might manage to rig up another.
We’ll try in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The meal, rude as it was, revived them all,
and cheered their drooping spirits. They discussed
the matter, and decided there was little
use in keeping a watch during the night. They
had just to float on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it’s good and dry in here, anyhow,”
observed Blake, as he crawled into one of the
bunks.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that’s another comfort, and we’ve got
more room than we had aboard the <i>Clytie</i>,” said
Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t go to making fun of the old craft,”
cautioned his chum. “She served us well. I’m
sorry she’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went to sleep with the rain pattering on
the roof of the cabin, thankful for the raft, in
spite of the havoc it had made in their plans.</p>

<p class='c008'>A dreary, drizzling day succeeded. They
made themselves as comfortable as they could in
the cabin, and went carefully over their food
supplies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Enough for two days, anyhow,” said Mr.
Ringold. “After that, well——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He shrugged his shoulders, and did not finish.
But they all knew what he meant.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were in the middle of a wide and desolate
stretch of the Mississippi. In the far distance,
as they rushed along with the swift current,
they could see small towns and villages.
They could not, however, reach them, for they
could not steer the raft. They tried to make a
long sweep, such as the lumbermen use, but they
had no pole long enough, and no tools with which
to cut one out of the lumber at their disposal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe and Blake did, indeed, try to construct a
pole out of one of the loose slabs on the side of
the shack, by splitting it with a small axe. But
the result was only a weak, wobbly staff, that
broke the first time it was used.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve just got to drift on—until something
happens,” said Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joe examined their cameras, for they had two,
and also the developed and undeveloped films.
The latter were safe in the water-tight cases. In
the afternoon, when it cleared a little, Joe and
Blake took more moving pictures from the front
end of the raft.</p>

<p class='c008'>They saw no craft of any kind. They seemed
alone on the waste of waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Night came, and they floated on. They ate
less now, for they wanted to make their food
supply last as long as possible. But the victuals
seemed to go alarmingly fast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe we’ll drift ashore to-morrow,” said
Mr. Ringold, hopefully. “If we do we’ll leave
the raft, and walk until we get to some place
where we can hire a boat. For, now that we
are reasonably certain that our friends are somewhere
down the river, we must make every effort
to find them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was about midnight when they were all
awakened by a severe shock.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” cried Mr. Ringold, leaping
from his bunk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We hit something!” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say we did!” yelled Blake. “We’re
ashore, that’s what we are. We’re not moving!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The raft was not moving, save for a slight undulating
motion, due to one end being afloat,
and the other on land; at least so they supposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Taking one of the lanterns, Blake went outside.
There was no rain, and a pale moon, behind
some watery clouds, gave a little light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” Joe wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve run into an island—or an island has
run into us,” Blake answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“An island!” echoed Mr. Ringold. “I was
hoping it was the mainland.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No such good luck,” went on Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>They joined him “on deck,” if one may use
such a term concerning a raft. Looking forward
they saw that the front, and jagged, end
of the raft—the same that had rammed and
sunk the <i>Clytie</i>—had struck on a small island,
and was wedged fast in the bank.</p>

<p class='c008'>They did not sleep much more that night. In
the morning, an examination showed that it
would be out of the question to remain on the
island, and leave the raft. The spot of land, in
the midst of the flood, was too small. Probably
when the river was at its ordinary height the
island was considerably larger. It proved of one
advantage to our friends, however, for there was
a spring in the middle of it, where the ground
was higher, and this gave them a supply of
fresh water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder if we couldn’t work the raft off?”
mused Blake, when they had eaten a very light
lunch, for their food was now very low.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the raft was too heavy, and too firmly
imbedded in the soft mud of the island, to enable
our friends, try as they might, to float it. They
toiled and tugged all the afternoon, for they felt
the almost vital necessity of getting away, and
reaching a place where they could get more food.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess we’re stuck—and stuck fast!” said
Blake, wearily. Then it began to rain again,
and they retired to the cabin and went to bed,
though no one slept much.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was about ten o’clock when Joe, getting up
for a drink, felt the raft suddenly move.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Something’s happening!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>At once they were all aroused. The affair of
logs trembled and shivered. Then, with a rending,
splintering sound she floated free of the
island.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re afloat again!” cried Joe. “The river
must have risen and pulled us free.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />ON A BIG ISLAND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Say, we’re having luck, all right!” exclaimed
Blake, when it was made certain that they were
adrift again. “I thought we’d be stuck on that
island for days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So did I,” returned Joe. “Yes, we’ve had
luck, of a certain kind, but it isn’t going to
feed us,” and he looked at the shelves of that
part of the cabin called the “pantry.” The
shelves were empty of all save one small tin of
corned beef, and a box of crackers. That, with
coffee, must be their breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seemed as though that night would never
pass. Slowly it wore on, and, through the storm
and darkness, through the rising water, floated
the raft, bearing the rescue party onward. It
was scarcely a rescue party any longer, however,
being more in need of rescue itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, desperate as their plight was, our friends
had not given up hope of finding and saving the
missing theatrical company. The chance and
hope were slim indeed, but Blake, Joe and the
two men were not of the sort that give up easily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Conditions must be fierce all along the
river, the way the water keeps on rising,” said
Blake, when the first faint streaks of dawn
showed in the gray, leaden-colored sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so!” agreed Joe. “The river
must have gone up almost a foot in the night,
to lift us off the island. It took considerable
power to pull the logs out of the mud where
they were stuck.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think the raft broke, and twisted away
from the front logs,” was Blake’s opinion,
and this, later, was found to be so. So firmly
imbedded in the mud had been the jagged and
sharp ends of the logs, that they had remained
there. But the stern of the raft, rising, had
broken the fastenings, and a section of it had
been left on the island.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All hands to breakfast!” called Mr. Piper,
a little later. “And curb your appetites,” he
added, grimly, as he pointed to the crackers and
corned beef on the rough table. “Don’t ask for
more than one helping of pie, only one slice of
white turkey meat to a customer, and no gravy.
What do you expect, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They made as merry as they could over the
frugal repast, but it was really no joke. Fortunately
the coffee held out, and they knew they
could live on that for some time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we could only work the raft to shore, or
signal for help to some steamer, we’d be all
right,” complained C. C. “But we can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The great flood had caused an almost complete
cessation of river navigation, at least in the
stretches where they now were. They had seen
no craft of any kind since being obliged to take
to the raft, and the river was so wide that they
could not communicate with towns on shore.
They passed several small hamlets that were deserted,
for the water was up to the second stories
of the houses. The inhabitants had fled back to
higher ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ve got to do something,” said
Blake, when noon came, and the pangs of hunger
were felt. “I wonder if we couldn’t build
a signal fire, or raise a flag of distress, or something
like that. It might bring help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We could try,” agreed Joe. “Let’s hoist a
blanket up on the lantern pole, and make a
smudge fire. It’ll be safe, for there’s so much
water around us that we can put it out easily
enough. It might do some good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A ragged blanket was nailed up as high on
the pole, amidships, as they could reach, by
standing on some boxes. Then preparations for
making a smudge fire, or one that smoked, rather
than blazed, went on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make it up forward,” suggested Mr. Ringold.
“And take a piece of the stove grate from
the oven to keep the blaze up from the logs.
They’re green, but they might burn through, and
cause trouble.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake went forward to look for a good place
to make the fire, which would be fed with damp
wood, to cause more smoke. Joe was preparing
some splinters and light kindling, from packing
boxes, to start it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, but I am hungry!” murmured Joe, as
he looked for matches.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So am I!” echoed his chum. “But I guess
we’ll have to take it out in—coffee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fire was made, and a dense cloud of smoke
arose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They ought to see that from shore, if it is
two or three miles away,” remarked C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If they’ll only come out to investigate, and
take us off,” spoke the manager. “Those who
see it may think it is only a pile of rubbish on
fire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ve done all we can,” said Blake,
despondently.</p>

<p class='c008'>A spirit of gloom seemed to have settled down
over them all. Probably the lack of food caused
it, though their plight was bad enough without
that being added to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Late in the afternoon, Blake, going forward
to put some more wet wood on the smouldering
blaze, came hurrying back with a strange look
on his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!” he cried to Joe, who was making a
pot of coffee, “there is some kind of an animal
on the front end of this raft.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Animal?” repeated Joe, wonderingly.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean just what I say. There is some animal
up forward there under that pile of boxes,”
for some empty packing cases were stacked up
front, evidently placed there by the lumbermen
to use, later, for fuel in the stove.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must be dreaming,” spoke Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not! Come and see!” invited Blake,
and, slipping into the cabin, he came out with
the small rifle he had taken from the motor
boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you going to do?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shoot it, if I get the chance,” replied his
chum, in determined tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Together the moving picture boys advanced
cautiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you happen to see it?” asked Joe,
as they approached the pile of boxes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it ran out just as I stooped over to
put some wood on the fire. Then, when it saw
me, it ran back again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What was it? How big was it?” Joe wanted
to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it was pretty big,” said Blake, “and it
looked like a muskrat, as much as anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe it was a muskrat,” Joe suggested.
“There must be a lot of ’em in this river, especially
since they’ve been driven out of their
homes by the high water.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are muskrats good to eat?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes, I’ve heard of people eating them,”
Joe replied, doubtfully. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because we might have to eat ’em,” Blake
went on, with a grim look coming over his face.
“I’m not going to starve.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t much fun,” admitted Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You go over there, and tear down the pile
of boxes,” suggested Blake, “and I’ll stand
ready to pop at it when the beast comes out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” assented Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>One by one he took away the empty boxes,
tossing them aside. He was soon down near the
bottom of the pile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There doesn’t seem to be anything here,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it’s in there, all right,” spoke Blake, confidently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hardly had the words left his lips than there
was a scurry in one of the boxes, and a big, grayish
animal ran out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There he goes!” cried Joe. “Pop him over!
Get him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake did not answer, but he threw the rifle
to his shoulder, took a quick aim, and pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a sharp report, a little squeal, and
then the animal, which had run out to seek new
shelter, curled up near the edge of the raft—dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s your muskrat,” said Blake, calmly.
“Now let’s eat him. We can’t be squeamish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Muskrat? That’s no muskrat!” yelled C.
C. Piper, as he came running up to inquire the
cause of the shot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it, then?” asked Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a ’possum, and a fine fat one, too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Opossum!” repeated Blake. “Is it good
to eat? That’s what interests me now, more
than what sort of an animal it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good to eat! I should say so!” cried the
moving picture actor. “They’re fine, baked
with sweet potatoes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ll have to get along without the
sweet potatoes, boys,” remarked Mr. Ringold,
laughingly. “But it’s lucky you got him, Blake.
Opossum is good eating.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake and Joe looked a bit doubtful, but, when
the animal was served, they ate with a zest that
comes from a good appetite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It must have jumped on the raft the time we
were stuck on the island,” said Joe. “And it’s
lucky for us that it did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The opossum, so providentially obtained,
served to put them over that day and part of
the next.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was nearly noon, and the last of the opossum
meat had been served, and the last of the
coffee made. Blake and Joe went down to the
pile of boxes, to lift them about again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We might find another ’possum,” remarked
Blake, and he took the rifle with him. But, to
their regret, there were no more aboard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d be glad to see even a muskrat,” spoke
Joe. But none of those animals, which are
greatly relished by some persons, was on the
raft.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we only had our fishing tackle, we might
try our luck in the river,” suggested C. C.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess we could rig up something,” said
Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no need to do this, as they found
some lines and hooks in the cabin. They used
some of the opossum skin for bait, but either the
river was too high, or the bait was not tempting
enough, for they got no bites.</p>

<p class='c008'>Late that afternoon the raft swung around a
bend in the river, and at once there appeared,
just below, a large island.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’re heading right for it!” yelled Blake.
“We’d better try to steer to one side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But to do this was out of the question. They
had no method of steering their unwieldy craft.</p>

<p class='c008'>On they rushed, straight for the island, which
was of large extent. It was quite high, and well
wooded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess we’ve got to land there whether we
want to or not,” cried Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hardly had he spoken, when the raft crashed
into the island. The forward logs were piled
up brokenly on the shore, and a creaking, splintering
sound gave warning that the raft was
going to pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s breaking up!” yelled Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Save what stuff you can!” shouted Joe.
“The cameras and films!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />THE LOST ONES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The raft, pushed hard against the end of the
island by the power of the river current, buckled.
The middle part rose up in the shape of the
inverted letter V. The logs tore from their fastenings
of ropes and chains, and broke and splintered
one against the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on!” yelled Blake. “Save what we
can!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He and the others rushed into the cabin, where
their things had been stored. There was no food
to be saved, and no time to roll off the water
barrel. They would have to take their chances
of finding a spring on the island, or drink the
river water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The cameras! The films!” cried Joe, again.
“Save them!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He and his chum gave their attention to these.
With them in their arms they rushed, as best
they could, over the raft toward land. Mr. Piper
and the manager looked after the clothing and
bedding.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time the raft had swung around,
broadside to the island, bringing the cabin that
much nearer the shore. This made it more easy
to save what few belongings they could take with
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Back and forth they ran from the raft to the
island. The cameras and the films were put in
a safe place, and then the two moving picture
boys helped in removing the other belongings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some clothing, some bedding, an axe, the rifle,
and a few other things were all they had time
to save. Then, with a splintering of timbers, a
cracking of chains and a parting of ropes, the
raft divided into two parts, one being swept
down one side of the island, and the other portion
down the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake, Joe and the two men stood beside their
little heap of belongings, looking at one another
with solemn faces.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment no one spoke. They looked at
the logs, rushing on down the river, and then
Blake said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, things haven’t stopped happening yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say not!” cried Joe. “This is
worse and more of it. What next?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No telling,” said C. C., gloomily. “We’ll
probably starve here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I hope not!” said Mr. Ringold, with
assumed cheerfulness. “There’s probably a restaurant
around the corner. We’ll go there and
have some roast chicken. Don’t all speak at
once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To the credit of Mr. Piper be it said that he
laughed. His gloomy periods seemed to be
leaving him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, let’s see where we’re at,” suggested
Mr. Ringold. “What have we here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing to eat; that’s certain,” remarked
Joe. “And I could take in a whole——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you dare say porterhouse steak!”
interrupted Blake. “That would be adding insult
to injury.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right; then I won’t,” agreed Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s coming on night,” spoke Mr. Ringold.
“If we can’t have supper we must, at least, provide
some sort of shelter. We have some blankets,
and we can cut down poles, and make a
tent. It looks as though it was going to rain
again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It sure does,” agreed Blake. “We’ve got
to have some sort of shelter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To say nothing of something to eat,” added
Joe, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eat! I’d give a good bit, just for a muskrat
sandwich!” said Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tired and discouraged, but still not giving up
all hope, our friends set to work to make a rude
tent. By the use of blankets and poles they
made one, well up from the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately the island was of high, sloping
formation, and, knowing that the river might
rise suddenly, they went far enough away from
the edge, to preclude any possibility of being
overwhelmed in the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This must be a big island,” observed Joe,
as he and Blake worked together. “When the
water is at the regular level it must be some miles
across.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess it is,” agreed his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Penetrating into the woods, in search of more
tent poles, Blake uttered a cry of surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?” shouted Joe. “Have
you found anything?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say I had!” answered Blake, as he
came rushing out with a square tin box in his
arms. “Look here! Pilot biscuit—a whole tin
of it, and only a little of it is wet! This will
keep us alive for a while, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where in the world did you find it?” asked
Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Back there, by that big tree. It must have
been washed down here by the flood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t care how it got here,” cried Joe,
“give me some.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ringold and Mr. Piper came up on the
run to view the find. As Blake had said, it was
a large tin of pilot biscuit, and only a little water
had come in, thanks to the waxed paper covering.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, if we only had the clam chowder that
goes with these crackers, wouldn’t it be great!”
mumbled Joe, as he took another pilot biscuit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quit it!” begged Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>For, be it known, pilot biscuit are large, hard,
round crackers, made on purpose for serving
with clam chowder, with which they make a most
excellent combination.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they sat there in the dusk, making a meal
off these crackers and drinking water (a spring
having been found), Mr. Piper asked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did you say you found these, Blake?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right up there, on that little knoll, by the
big tree.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And how did you say you thought they got
there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I suppose the flood must have carried
away a country store, and washed the box up
there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you see any other stuff washed up there—anything
other than debris, or anything else
in the eating line?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a thing—I wish I had.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” remarked Mr. Piper, “I don’t wish
to raise false hopes, or anything like that, but
I should say that this tin of pilot biscuit was
dropped, or left, up there by someone who has
been on, or who is still on, this island!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean—people?” cried Blake, leaping to
his feet in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what I mean. Why, this box of
crackers never was washed up there by the flood—the
water didn’t come high enough. That
box was dropped there by someone who took
refuge on this island.”</p>

<p class='c008'>For a moment no one spoke, after C. C.’s announcement.
Then Mr. Ringold remarked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe you’re right!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I’m right,” declared the actor.
“Why, it stands to reason that the box of biscuit
was never washed up here. The flood
hasn’t got that high yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And do you think whoever dropped it is still
here?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s more than I can say,” went on Mr.
Piper. “They may have been here a short time,
and gone off again. Pilot biscuit is often carried
on boats, for it keeps well, and is always good
eating. Some boating party may have been here
before the flood, having a picnic, as it were.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t talk of picnics!” begged Blake. “It
makes me think of good things to eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, aren’t you eating?” Joe wanted to
know, with a grim smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s better than nothing,” admitted Blake, as
he took another cracker.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our friends passed a wretched night. If you
have ever tried to sleep in a leaky tent, in the
rain, having had nothing worth while to eat, and,
at the same time, anxious about your safety, you
can, perhaps, imagine what Blake, Joe and the
others suffered. They slept in fitful dozes, in
spite of their wretchedness, and how they welcomed
the morning light, raining though it was!</p>

<p class='c008'>“First call for breakfast!” shouted Joe, as
he brought out the tin of biscuits. “Regular
prison fare—bread and water,” he commented,
with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it’s better than nothing,” declared Mr.
Piper, and the others rejoiced that, in this time
of adversity, he could be so cheerful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving the cameras and films under cover of
the tent and some blankets, as well as in the
water-proof coverings, the party set off on a tour
of exploration.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll see if there are any persons on this
island,” said Mr. Ringold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the rain they started off. It was not
easy going, and they were weak from lack of
proper food.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, doggedly, they kept on. There was a hill
in about the centre of the island, a hill that would
seem to give a good view of the surrounding
land.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake reached the summit first. He looked
about him, and then gazed, steadfastly and earnestly,
into a little glade that was below him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“See anything?” asked Joe, as he panted up
after his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know—I—I——” and Blake’s voice
trembled. “Are those tents down there, Joe,
or—or is it only mist?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re tents all right, old man! Big tents,
too! Say, there are people here!” he fairly
shouted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on!” cried Blake, starting down the
slope.</p>

<p class='c008'>They fairly ran down the hill. A little way
from the tents the party of refugees came to a
halt. Blake rubbed his eyes, as though to brush
away clinging cobwebs. He stared at a girl who
came from one of the tents.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Birdie Lee!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blake Stewart!” came the surprised answer.
“You here!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the two stared wonderingly at each other.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />RISING WATERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Others came running out of the tents—Mr.
Robertson, Mr. Levinberg, Miss Shay—several
other actors and actresses, and also the moving
picture operators.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look—look!” cried Birdie, pointing to
Blake. “Is it Blake, or am I dreaming?”</p>

<p class='c008'>No one answered her for a moment. They
were all too surprised. Then, looking back up
the hill, the company of players saw Joe, Mr.
Ringold and C. C. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you get here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did you come from?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Were you looking for us?”</p>

<p class='c008'>These were some of the questions rapidly fired
back and forth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!” cried Blake, at length. “Have you
anything to eat? We’re most starved—nothing
but some pilot biscuits that we found in a
tin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There!” cried Birdie Lee. “I knew we left
those biscuits behind. We must have dropped
them when we moved our camp. And I did so
want them with the canned clam chowder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Clam chowder!” cried Joe. “Say, where is
it? I’ll eat the can itself!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But where did you come from? How did
you get here?” asked Mr. Levinberg.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s feed them first, and have explanations
afterward,” suggested Birdie Lee, as she clasped
a hand each, of Blake and Joe. “Oh, we are so
glad to see you!” she cried, impulsively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just a word of explanation!” begged Mr.
Ringold. “I can’t understand this. How did
you folks get here? We’ve been looking for you
all along the river.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We hoped somebody would come for us,”
said Miss Shay. “Have you a boat so you can
take us to shore?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A boat? No!” cried Blake. “Our motor
boat was hit by a raft and sunk, and then the
raft hit this island and went to pieces. We’re
stranded. Haven’t you folks a boat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a boat,” said Mr. Robertson, with a
shake of his head. “We’re marooned on the
island.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on! I’m sure they must be starved!”
laughed Birdie Lee. “Feed them first, and talk
afterward. At least we have plenty of food.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, when the moving picture boys and their
companions had made a hasty meal, explanations
were made.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were caught in the flood, when we went
to that first island,” said Mr. Levinberg, “and
carried down the river in our boat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we thought surely we would be
drowned,” put in Miss Shay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we weren’t,” resumed the chief actor.
“Fortunately our boat was a large one, and we
had plenty of food and supplies. We went out
equipped for a long stay, you know, with tents
that were to be used in some of the island scenes,
and many other things. We had time to put
most of these aboard the boat, before the flood
came.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we tried to get back to Hannibal, but
the current was too much for us. So we decided
to come on down, and trust to luck. But luck
was against us, for our rudder broke, and we
could not ship a new one. So we were carried
on down, utterly unable to guide our boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We tried to signal for help, but we were
carried too far out to allow our signals or cries
to be heard by persons in the towns we passed.
Anyhow, I guess they had their own troubles.
We met no other steamers, and all we could do
was to come on with the flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Finally we swashed into a house, and, house,
boat and all, we landed on this island, and we’ve
been here ever since,” concluded the actor.
“We’ve been hoping against hope that someone
would come to our relief, for, though we still
have considerable food, it will not last forever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But where is the boat in which you came
here?” asked Mr. Ringold. “Can’t you repair
the rudder and use it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We haven’t the boat now,” said Birdie.
“The high water carried it away one night, and
the house too, though we saved some stuff from
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s right,” said Mr. Levinberg, “our
boat slipped her cable, and went on down stream.
Luckily we had all our supplies out of her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We landed at the end of the island where
you struck,” the actor went on. “We made a
camp there, and then moved up here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that’s how we left behind the tin of
pilot biscuit for clam chowder,” said Birdie.</p>

<p class='c008'>More and detailed explanations of the experiences
of the two parties were exchanged, and
then preparations were made for housing the
four newcomers for the night. There was
another tent that could be put up—one of several
taken along to be used in the picture films—and
with their own bedding our friends were
made fairly comfortable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, but it seems good to eat once more!”
remarked Joe, at supper that night. “Nothing
but crackers and water—whew!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And ’possum!” added Blake, and he told of
shooting that animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fairly complete camping outfit had been
brought along and saved by the picture players,
and this did good service now. Of course the
food was all of the canned variety, but even
that was welcome in the emergency.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day after the two parties were united
proved bright and sunny, and Joe and Blake
took a number of pictures of the players and the
flood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the river is still rising,” reported Mr.
Ringold, with a worried look, as he came back
from a trip to the shore of the island. “If it
covers this place——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where will we be?” asked Mr. Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one answered him.</p>

<p class='c008'>And that the water might rise even high
enough to completely cover the island seemed
very possible, for, in spite of the brightness of
the morning, it rained hard in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inch by inch the waters rose. Faster and
madder they swirled past the island on either
side. Gradually the area of land grew smaller
and smaller.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We shall have to move the tents,” said Mr.
Ringold, on the second day. “We must go to
the highest point possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was hard work shifting camp in the rain,
but it had to be done. Finally the white canvas
houses were set up on the top of the knoll
whence Blake had looked down to see their
friends whom they sought.</p>

<p class='c008'>And still the rain came down, and still the
waters rose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Another day, at this rate, and it will be all
over—except the swimming,” said C. C., grimly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t we make a raft?” asked Blake. “We
have an axe, and there are trees to be cut down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good!” cried Mr. Ringold. “We should
have thought of that before. We’ll build a raft!
On that we may float to safety.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />THE GOVERNMENT BOAT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But building a raft was not an easy matter.
True, the trees could be cut down, but our
friends were not skillful woodsmen, and there
was nothing with which to bind the logs together.
There were some tent ropes, but they were
needed to keep up the canvas shelters as long
as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll do the best we can, though,” decided
Mr. Ringold, as he and the men and boys labored
at the raft.</p>

<p class='c008'>They hastened with the work, for the water
crept higher and higher. By using tough withes,
and wild grapevines, they managed to bind the
logs fairly well, but, at best, the raft was a very
frail affair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll never trust myself on that!” declared
Miss Shay, shuddering.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t much fancy it myself,” admitted Mr.
Piper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it will be better than staying here and
getting—well, getting your feet wet,” spoke
Blake. He was going to say “drowned,” but
changed his mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Higher and higher came the water. There
was now only a space of not more than a hundred
feet square, to which the refugees had retreated
as an area of safety. The raft floated in
the water, moored by a long rope of twisted
grapevine, and ready for our friends to embark
on it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Packages of food were made ready to be taken
along, and also a keg of fresh water. The water
supply troubled them, as the spring was now
covered by the flood, and all they had was some
which they had stored for just that emergency.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll take along the tents,” said Mr. Ringold.
“They’ll come in useful, as shelter on the
raft.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we’ll have to take to the raft in the
morning, I think,” Mr. Piper said. “At the rate
the river is rising, we won’t have ground under
our feet much longer than that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gloomy, uncertain and miserable was that
night. The campfire, which had hitherto been
kept up, not without a great deal of work, went
out in the rain, and, save for a few lanterns,
there was no light. Naturally there was no heat,
and cold victuals were the portion of the refugees.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still no one complained, even C. C. maintaining
a brave front in the face of danger and privation.
Everything possible was made ready for
embarking on the raft in the morning. After
that——</p>

<p class='c008'>No one knew what would happen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose we’ll have to abandon everything,”
said Birdie Lee, talking to Joe and Blake, after
“supper,” if so the meal could be designated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m going to stick to the films and the
camera to the last!” exclaimed Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s what!” cried Joe. “We may get to
some place where we’ll be able to get a few more
pictures.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The night passed slowly and miserably. At
the first streak of dawn Blake was astir, ready
to help take down the tents and load the raft.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, as he looked toward the place where it
had been tied, he saw only the twisted end of
the grapevine cable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The raft is gone!” he cried. “It’s been
carried away in the flood!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” called Joe, hardly believing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The raft is gone! And our last chance is
gone with it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hurriedly they all came out of the tents. It
was but too true. The rising waters had pulled
and tugged at the raft, until they had carried it
down stream.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no time to make another. Already
the space on which the refugees had taken shelter
was growing smaller. Inch by inch the
waters rose. The pegs of one of the tents, in
which supplies were kept, were now being lapped
by the muddy waves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, for a boat!” cried Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ve got to do something!” yelled Joe.
“We can’t stay here much longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was evident to all. Yet what could be
done?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cut down some trees!” cried Mr. Ringold.
“We can use them for life preservers, and perhaps
float to safety. Cut down trees!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This means good-bye to our films!” sighed
Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If not good-bye to ourselves,” echoed his
chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was little time left. With the one axe,
and the camp hatchet, the men began chopping
away at the trees on the summit of the hill,
where the refugees had made their last stand
against the rising waters. They could remain
there but an hour longer, at most.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blake and Joe carried their camera and
waterproof packages of exposed film, to the dryest
place they could find, in one of the tents.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We can’t take any food with us, when we
float down on the logs,” said Mr. Piper, sadly.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one had the heart to answer him.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were now gathered together in a space
about fifty feet across, on the very summit of
the hill. Several trees grew there, and, by climbing
into them, it might be possible to remain
above the rising water a little longer. But would
even this respite save them? It did not seem
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tree trunks had been felled, and were in
readiness. They would make but poor life preservers
at best, but better than nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inch by inch the water rose. Birdie Lee,
Miss Shay and some of the other actresses were
in a group, looking at each other with tear-stained
faces. It seemed the end of everything.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly, through the moisture-laden air,
came a shrill whistle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” cried Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sounded like a steamboat!” answered Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It <i>is</i> a steamboat!” called Birdie Lee, as
she looked down the flooded river. “See!
There she comes! Oh, we are saved!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank the dear Lord,” echoed Miss Shay.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pushing her way up against the powerful
current, was a big boat—a steamer—from the funnels
of which belched black smoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wave something!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Call to them!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make them hear us!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Show a signal!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus cried the refugees, as they saw help approaching.
In another instant the boys and men
raised their voices in a united shout, and coats
and caps were frantically waved to attract the
attention of the pilot of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He sees us! He’s coming!” cried Blake, joyfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And just about in time, too,” added Joe,
for the water was creeping higher and higher.</p>

<p class='c008'>With loud blasts of the whistle the pilot indicated
that he had seen the signals of distress,
and was coming to the rescue. In quick time a
small boat was lowered, and a few minutes later
the refugees were safe on board the steamer,
which proved to be a government boat, sent out
to aid in the rescue work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And we’ve saved our films and cameras,
too!” cried Joe, for the moving picture apparatus,
as well as some of the personal effects of
the stranded ones, had been brought away from
the summit of the island, which alone was out
of water, now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and if we get a chance we’ll use up
the rest of the undeveloped film, and get more
flood pictures,” added Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll leave you at the first large town,”
said the captain. “I guess the flood is at its
height now. It won’t get much higher, and there
isn’t much use in me going farther up the river
until I take care of the passengers I’ve already
picked up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Accordingly he turned back, and that afternoon
our friends and several others were taken
ashore. The place where they were landed was
within a few miles of a good-sized town, and
they found quarters there, being well looked
after by the hospitable inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’re safe, anyhow,” murmured Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and no more Mississippi life for me—especially
in a flood,” added Joe. “I’ve had all
I want.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the boys were not quite done with the
flood. There were two or three more days of
high water, and in that time they managed to
get some wonderful pictures, going out in a hired
boat. Then, having no more undeveloped film,
they packed up their cameras, and waited for
the waters to subside.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rains ceased, the sun came out, and the
Mississippi River began to assume its normal
level. Gradually the distressing scenes of the
flood disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we certainly got some great pictures,”
said Blake, when the last of the reels had been
packed up for shipment to New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so!” agreed his chum, “and we’ve
got a great story to tell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s been about the most exciting time we
ever had, since we got into this business,” went
on Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not even excepting earthquake land,”
laughed Joe. “I wonder if we’ll ever duplicate
this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And whether they did or not may be learned
by reading the next book in this series, to be
called: “The Moving Picture Boys at Panama;
Or, Stirring Adventures Along the Great Canal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And now, I believe, I have told you all there
is to tell concerning the adventures of Blake and
Joe in the big Mississippi River flood. With the
going down of the waters all danger was passed,
though the peril had been great, and the toll of
lives and property heavy. But, aside from the
loss of some personal belongings, and the films
which the theatrical company had taken, matters
were not so bad. And the loss of the dramatic
films was more than balanced by the ones taken
by Joe and Blake of the big inundation.</p>

<p class='c008'>By a lucky chance a clew was obtained to the
stolen films of the relief train, and others, taken
at that time. As had been suspected, Munson,
or, rather, the Pullman car porter, whom he had
bribed to do so, had stolen the films. But when
an attempt was made to exhibit them our friends
heard about it and secured the valuable celluloid
strips. This was as far as Munson’s plot
went.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what are you going to do now?” asked
Birdie Lee, of Blake and Joe, when they were
once more on their way home, away from the
flooded district, that was rapidly drying up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what I’m going to do,” said Blake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going back to that farm, and finish out
my vacation,” answered his chum.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I think I’ll send the rest of the theatrical
company along with you,” said Mr. Ringold.
“They are certainly entitled to a rest after
what they’ve suffered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so, for a time, we will take leave of our
moving picture boys and their associates, and
say good-bye.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moving pictures and photo plays are famous the world over,
and in this line of books the reader is given a full description
of how the films are made—the scenes of little dramas, indoors
and out, trick pictures to satisfy the curious, soul-stirring pictures
of city affairs, life in the Wild West, among the cowboys
and Indians, thrilling rescues along the seacoast, the daring of
picture hunters in the jungle among savage beasts, and the
great risks run in picturing conditions in a land of earthquakes.
The volumes teem with adventures and will be found
interesting from first chapter to last.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Never was there a cleaner, brighter, more manly boy
than Frank Allen, the hero of this series of boys’ tales, and
never was there a better crowd of lads to associate with than
the students of the School. All boys will read these stories
with deep interest. The rivalry between the towns along the
river was of the keenest, and plots and counterplots to win
the champions, at baseball, at football, at boat racing, at
track athletics, and at ice hockey, were without number.
Any lad reading one volume of this series will surely want
the others.</p>
